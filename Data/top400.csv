4000,Garry's Mod,2006-11-29,0,5.99,0,"Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. There aren't any predefined aims or goals. We give you the tools and leave you to play. You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name yet - that's up to you. You can do it offline, or join the thousands of players who play online each day. If you're not too great at construction - don't worry! You can place a variety of characters in silly positions. But if you want to do more, we have the means. Beyond the Sandbox The Garry's Mod community is a tremendous source of content and has added hundreds of unique modes to the game. In Trouble In Terrorist Town, you can be a detective solving an online murder as criminals attempt to cover up their homicides. Be a ball, a plant, a chair, or anything else in Prop Hunt's elaborate, shape-shifting game of Hide &amp; Seek. Elevator: Source is gaming's first elevator thrill ride, delivering players to airlocks and kitten dance parties. We have one of the most vibrant Steam Community Workshops, with over 300'000 models, maps, and contraptions to download. It has everything from new tools to improve your builds, to guns that fire rainbow-tinged nuclear blasts from space. Take as much or as little as you need: it’s all free. Please note: Some multiplayer servers and game-modes might require you to own other games - such as Counter-Strike: Source and Team Fortress 2. ","Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. There aren't any predefined aims or goals. We give you the tools and leave you to play. You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name yet - that's up to you. You can do it offline, or join the thousands of players who play online each day. If you're not too great at construction - don't worry! You can place a variety of characters in silly positions. But if you want to do more, we have the means. Beyond the Sandbox The Garry's Mod community is a tremendous source of content and has added hundreds of unique modes to the game. In Trouble In Terrorist Town, you can be a detective solving an online murder as criminals attempt to cover up their homicides. Be a ball, a plant, a chair, or anything else in Prop Hunt's elaborate, shape-shifting game of Hide &amp; Seek. Elevator: Source is gaming's first elevator thrill ride, delivering players to airlocks and kitten dance parties.

Mysterious abilities are awakening inside you, drawn from a mind flayer parasite planted in your brain. Resist, and turn darkness against itself. Or embrace corruption, and become ultimate evil. From the creators of Divinity: Original Sin 2 comes a next-generation RPG, set in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Choose from 12 classes and 11 races from the D&amp;D Player's Handbook and create your own identity, or play as an Origin hero with a hand-crafted background.

Whoever you choose to be, adventure, loot, battle and romance your way across the Forgotten Realms and beyond. Gather your party. Take the adventure online as a party of up to four. Abducted, infected, lost. You are turning into a monster, but as the corruption inside you grows, so does your power. That power may help you to survive, but there will be a price to pay, and more than any ability, the bonds of trust that you build within your party could be your greatest strength.

Kennedy, Jill Valentine. OVERVIEW About the Game Death Is Not an Escape. Trapped forever in a realm of eldritch evil where even death is not an escape, four determined Survivors face a bloodthirsty Killer in a vicious game of nerve and wits. Pick a side and step into a world of tension and terror with horror gaming's best asymmetrical multiplayer. Survivors play in third-person and have the advantage of better situational awareness. The Killer plays in first-person and is more focused on their prey. The Survivors' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you play. Key Features • Survive Together… Or Not - Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish. Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone. Will you be able to outwit the Killer and escape their Killing Ground? • Where Am I? - Each level is procedurally generated, so you’ll never know what to expect. Random spawn points mean you will never feel safe as the world and its danger change every time you play. • A Feast for Killers - Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. As a Killer you can play as anything from a powerful Slasher to terrifying paranormal entities. Familiarize yourself with your Killing Grounds and master each Killer’s unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice your victims. • Deeper and Deeper - Each Killer and Survivor has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your own personal strategy. Experience, skills and understanding of the environment are key to being able to hunt or outwit the Killer. • Real People, Real Fear - The procedural levels and real human reactions to pure horror makes each game session an unexpected scenario. You will never be able to tell how it’s going to turn out. Ambience, music, and chilling environments combine into a terrifying experience. With enough time, you might even discover what’s hiding in the fog. WARNING: PHOTOSENSITIVITY/EPILEPSY SEIZURES - READ THIS NOTICE BEFORE PLAYING A very small percentage of people may experience epileptic seizures or blackouts when exposed to certain kinds of flashing lights or light patterns. These persons, or even people who have no history of seizures or epilepsy, may experience epileptic symptoms or seizures while playing video games. If you or any of your relatives has an epileptic condition or has had seizures of any kind, consult your physician before playing any video game. IMMEDIATELY DISCONTINUE use and consult a physician if you or your child experience any of the following symptoms: dizziness, altered vision, eye or muscle twitching, involuntary movements, loss of awareness, disorientation, or convulsions. Parents should watch for or ask their children about the above symptoms. You may reduce risk of photosensitive epileptic seizures by taking the following precautions: sit farther from the screen, use a smaller screen, play in a well-lit room, do not play when you are drowsy or fatigued.

346110,ARK: Survival Evolved,2017-08-27,0,14.99,15,"ARK: Survival Ascended! Respawn into a new dinosaur survival experience beyond your wildest dreams… as ARK is reimagined from the ground-up into the next-generation of videogame technology with Unreal Engine 5! You awake on a mysterious island, your senses overwhelmed by the blinding sunlight and brilliant colors bouncing off every surface around you, the azure waters of a verdant Island lapping at your bare feet. A deep roar echoes from the misty jungle, jolting you into action, and you stand up – not afraid, but intrigued. Are you ready to form a tribe, tame and breed hundreds of species of dinosaurs and other primeval creatures, explore, craft, build, and fight your way to the top of the food-chain? Your new world awaits… step through the looking-glass and join it! ARK: Genesis Part Two! Your quest for ultimate survival is now complete with the launch of ARK: Genesis Part 2! Survivors will conclude the ARK storyline while adventuring through exotic new worlds with all-new mission-based gameplay. Discover, utilize and master new creatures, new craftable items, weapons, and structures unlike anything you have seen yet! The saga is now complete, and hundreds of hours of new story-oriented ARK gameplay await you! Purchased as part of the ARK: Genesis Season Pass you gain access to two new huge story-oriented expansion packs -- Genesis Part 1 and Genesis Part 2 (new!) -- as well as a 'Noglin' Chibi cosmetic, a ‘Shadowmane’ Chibi cosmetic, a new cosmetic armor set, and an in-game, artificially intelligent companion called ‘HLN-A’ who can scan additional hidden Explorer Notes found throughout the other ARKs. Features the voiceover talent of David Tennant (Doctor Who, Good Omens) playing the villainous Sir Edmund Rockwell, and Madeleine Madden (The Wheel of Time, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Dora and the Lost City of Gold) as in-game robotic AI companion HLN-A/Helena Walker. About the Game As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame &amp; breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape! Dinosaurs, Creatures, &amp; Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&amp;-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator &amp; prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies! You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants &amp; meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing &amp; armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage &amp; extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system! By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style. Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians &amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner! By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated. Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village! All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new 'Engrams' to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D 'Explorer Notes'. By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose! Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted &amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames! The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text &amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct &amp; draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray... And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned. On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises. You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create! The over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting &amp; global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) &amp; true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

218620,PAYDAY 2,2013-08-13,18,9.99,78,"PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree. The CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands? Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear. Key Features Rob Banks, Get Paid – Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side. CRIMENET – The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician 'The Elephant', and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind. PAYDAY Gunplay and Mechanics on a New Level – Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good. Dynamic Scenarios – No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events. Choose Your Skills – As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister. More Masks than Ever – PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask with a pattern and color of their choice, resulting in millions of different combinations. Weapons and Modifications – A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you've settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine? Play It Your Way – Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes or running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, each approach will provide a different experience. A Long History of Additional Content – More than 70 updates since release, including new heists, characters, weapons and other gameplay features like driving cars and forklifts. ","PAYDAY 2 is an action-packed, four-player co-op shooter that once again lets gamers don the masks of the original PAYDAY crew - Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains - as they descend on Washington DC for an epic crime spree. The CRIMENET network offers a huge range of dynamic contracts, and players are free to choose anything from small-time convenience store hits or kidnappings, to big league cyber-crime or emptying out major bank vaults for that epic PAYDAY. While in DC, why not participate in the local community, and run a few political errands? Up to four friends co-operate on the hits, and as the crew progresses the jobs become bigger, better and more rewarding. Along with earning more money and becoming a legendary criminal comes a character customization and crafting system that lets crews build and customize their own guns and gear. Key Features Rob Banks, Get Paid – Players must choose their crew carefully, because when the job goes down they will need the right mix of skills on their side. CRIMENET – The dynamic contract database lets gamers pick and choose from available jobs by connecting with local contacts such as Vlad the Ukrainian, shady politician 'The Elephant', and South American drug trafficker Hector, all with their own agenda and best interests in mind. PAYDAY Gunplay and Mechanics on a New Level – Firing weapons and zip tying civilians never felt so good. Dynamic Scenarios – No heist ever plays out the same way twice. Every single scenario has random geometry or even rare events. Choose Your Skills – As players progress they can invest in any of five special Skill Trees: Mastermind, Enforcer, Ghost, Technician and Fugitive. Each features a deep customization tree of associated skills and equipment to master, and they can be mixed and matched to create the ultimate heister. More Masks than Ever – PAYDAY 2 features a completely new mask system, giving players the ability to craft their own unique mask with a pattern and color of their choice, resulting in millions of different combinations. Weapons and Modifications – A brand new arsenal for the serious heister, covering everything from sniper and assault rifles to compact PDWs and SMGs. Once you've settled for a favorite, you can modify it with optics, suppressors, fore grips, reticles, barrels, frames, stocks and more, all of which will affect the performance of your weapon. There are also purely aesthetic enhancements - why not go for the drug lord look with polished walnut grips for your nine? Play It Your Way – Each job allows for multiple approaches, such as slow and stealthy ambushes or running in guns blazing. Hit the target any way you want, each approach will provide a different experience. A Long History of Additional Content – More than 70 updates since release, including new heists, characters, weapons and other gameplay features like driving cars and forklifts.

DayZ includes the original Chernarus terrain, and the Livonia terrain. Chernarus – The iconic DayZ terrain, set in the post-soviet state of Chernarus and encompassing 230 km2 of hand-crafted environment based on real life locations. Livonia – The dense 163 km2 map lets players experience the hardcore survival hit in a whole new environment. Players can put their survival skills to the test by venturing into the unfamiliar land of Livonia, and seeing just how long they can last in this deadlier-than-ever world. Meet Others Up to 60 players are struggling to survive by any means necessary at any given time. Make friends, kill on sight, build a base, or risk being betrayed over a can of tasty beans. Use VOIP to interact with other players however you see fit. Every encounter is meaningful when your life is always on the line. Be wary. Stay alert. Trust no one. Survive Chernarus The infected aren’t the only ones you need to worry about – there’s also the wildlife and elements. Evade packs of wolves and frenzied bears, find shelter from the punishing rain, search for light in the darkness of night. You’ll also need to master complex survival mechanics concerning your hunger, thirst, body temperature, and more. Loot Up Always make sure your gear is ready. Patch up damaged clothes, craft improvised items, and head out to deceptively dead cities to scavenge for valuable resources.

Don’t forget that you won’t get far without a full hazard suit and gas mask.

Some survivors want your loot, others are simply hunting for sport. Then there are those who are afraid you’ll shoot first. Learn how to fight and know when the time has come to swallow your pride and flee. One bullet can change absolutely everything. Always watch your back. Install Mods Head on over to the Steam Workshop and find a customized server that fits. Join an active community of like-minded players and modify your DayZ experience to suit your taste. Browse thousands of fan-made features, maps, and guns – all of which are easily managed directly from the game launcher.

Explore murky swamps, abandoned hunting cabins, sawmills and deforested areas, as well as massive quarries containing stashes of leftover explosives. Follow the bear Livonia’s food supply is scarce. If you want to survive, you’ll have to learn how to hunt, fish, and forage in the unforgiving wilderness. Luckily, the land appears to be more alive now than it ever was before the apocalypse. Discover the secret Venture south and find the hidden entrance that leads to a mysterious underground complex. Make sure you’re with a friend while you look for a way in. And don’t forget to bring some supplies, especially a flashlight. Otherwise you might get lost in the darkened maze of corridors awaiting all who enter.

1623730,Palworld,2024-01-18,0,22.49,1,"Q. What kind of game is this? A. In this game, you can peacefully live alongside mysterious creatures known as Pals or risk your life to drive off a ruthless poaching syndicate. Pals can be used to fight, or they can be made to work on farms or factories. You can even sell them or eat them! Survival In a harsh environment where food is scarce and vicious poachers roam, danger waits around every corner. To survive, you must tread carefully and make difficult choices...even if that means eating your own Pals when the time comes. Mounts &amp; Exploration Pals can be mounted to traverse the land, sea and sky—allowing you to traverse all kinds of environment as you explore the world. Building Structures Want to build a pyramid? Put an army of Pals on the job. Don't worry; there are no labor laws for Pals. Production Make use of Pals and their skills to make fire, generate electricity, or mine ore so that you can live a life of comfort. Farming Some Pals are good at planting seeds, while others are skilled at watering or harvesting crops. Work together with your Pals to create an idyllic farmstead. Factories &amp; Automation Letting Pals do the work is the key to automation. Build a factory, place a Pal in it, and they'll keep working as long as they're fed—until they're dead, that is. Dungeon Exploration With Pals on your side you can tackle even the most dangerous areas. When the time comes, you might have to sacrifice one to save your skin. They'll protect your life—even if it costs their own. Breeding &amp; Genetics Breed a Pal and it will inherit the characteristics of its parents. Combine rare pals to create the strongest Pal of them all! Poaching &amp; Crime Endangered Pals live in wildlife sanctuaries. Sneak in and capture rare Pals to get rich quick! It's not a crime if you don't get caught, after all. Multiplayer Multiplayer is supported, so invite a friend and go on an adventure together! And of course you can battle your friends and trade Pals, too. In online co-op play mode, up to 4 players can play together. Additionally, a dedicated server can allow up to 32 players to play together. ","Q. What kind of game is this? A.

It’s a time of expanded operations for everyone’s favourite fishing family, installing new stations at the Outposts and commissioning Voyages for pirates to help tackle the rise of these wild beasts.  New kinds of Megalodon, unique Treasured Fish and even wild boars have been spied throughout the Sea of Thieves, promising rich rewards for the hunter cunning enough to best them.  Reputation Rising The Hunter’s Call are stepping up: pirates will now be able to continue earning reputation through five levels of Distinction, enabling them to progress far past what was previously possible with this Trading Company. A range of new Company-specific loot also provides a fresh incentive for rising through the ranks…  Represent the Company Truly dedicated hunters can now risk their lives and their loot in service to the Company as an Emissary! As with other Trading Companies, flying an Emissary Flag will guarantee increased rewards for any loot you turn in, but also makes you a target for any other pirates in the area looking to pick a fight. Fishing and Raid Voyages Many hunters are happy to go wherever the wind takes them, but The Hunter’s Call are offering a little more direction to those who want it. New Fishing and Raid Voyages will be made available as pirates rank up with the Company, promising a range of rewards for successfully completed missions.  You’re Going to Need a Bigger Galleon The familiar Megalodons of the Sea of Thieves are fearsome beasts, but it turns out that even darker creatures have been dwelling beneath the waves… The Feared Redmaw and Barnacled Dread have crossed over from the Sea of the Damned, and now lie in wait to terrorise sailors with their ferocity and alarming special abilities.  Crews attacked by the Feared Redmaw will need to ensure they’ve got plenty of water ready to put out her fires, while those facing down the Barnacled Dread should watch for Ocean Crawlers boarding their ship to upset the odds. Hunter’s Call Grade 5 Emissaries will at least have an advantage in being able to spot these emergent new Megalodon threats on their ship’s map!  New Seasonal Rewards A new Season means a brand new set of rewards, unlocked by climbing through 100 levels of Renown! Earn cosmetics, gold, Doubloons and even Ancient Coins as you rise through the ranks by living the pirate life.  About the Game Sea of Thieves offers the essential pirate experience, from sailing and fighting to exploring and looting – everything you need to live the pirate life and become a legend in your own right.

Setting Once every decade, elder dragons trek across the sea to travel to the land known as the New World in a migration referred to as the Elder Crossing. To get to the bottom of this mysterious phenomenon, the Guild has formed the Research Commission, dispatching them in large fleets to the New World. As the Commission sends its Fifth Fleet in pursuit of the colossal elder dragon, Zorah Magdaros, one hunter is about to embark on a journey grander than anything they could have ever imagined.

This game is for people who enjoy throwing around ragdolls but want it to be more detailed, satisfying, and feel more free while doing so. Ragdolls are simple on the outside but detailed on the inside. You can siphon their blood and replace it with nitroglycerine. You can submerge their head and cause brain damage by asphyxiation. Think of something horrible, and you can probably do it in People Playground. Afterwards, you could even hook them up to an ECG and blood supply to try to get them back on their feet. Every object in the game has its own physical properties: weight, sharpness, thermal and electrical conductivity, ferromagnetism, heat capacity, bullet resistance, and so on. The game simulates temperature, heat transfer through objects and through the air, electricity, and rigid body dynamics. All these systems combined make for emergent gameplay. You may experience behaviour that was never explicitly implemented. Mutilation aside, you are encouraged to build interesting contraptions or download them from the Steam Workshop. Construct airplanes, walkers, impenetrable bases, automatic doors, shields, computers, unholy weaponry - it's up to you! Once you get bored of the limited amount of items, you may download one of many Workshop mods and addons to expand the toy box, or you could make your own.","Shoot, stab, burn, poison, tear, vaporise, or crush ragdolls.

That means avatars that flow with your movement, and systems that work alongside various hardware platforms to provide full-body tracking, finger tracking, and much, much more. There’s something magical around every corner. Come take a look, and see what you find. In VRChat, there’s always something to do – and people to meet there. Visit a planetarium and have a chat about astronomy. Go on a virtual hike through a majestic fantasy forest. Pull up to a car meet, and talk shop with some gearheads.

Created by hardcore gamers, Path of Exile is an online Action RPG set in a dark fantasy world. With a focus on visceral action combat, powerful items and deep character customization, Path of Exile is completely free and will never be pay-to-win. Key Features Freedom. Power. Revenge. Path of Exile is an online Action RPG designed around a strong online item economy and deep character customisation. Path of Exile is set in the dark fantasy world of Wraeclast. Scarred by mysterious catastrophes of the past and inhabited by creatures of nightmare, the very environment challenges exiles who dare explore it. You play as the Duelist, Witch, Ranger, Templar, Marauder, Shadow or the Scion class. From forsaken shores through to the city of Oriath, explore Wraeclast and uncover the ancient secrets waiting for you. Unlimited Character Customization Create and customise hundreds of unique skill combinations from tradable itemised gems and our gigantic Passive Skill Tree. Combine skill gems, support gems and trigger gems to create your own unique combination of power, defence and destruction. All of Path of Exile's character classes share its vast Passive Skill Tree. Starting at one of seven distinct locations dictated by their chosen class, players can focus on the core specialities of their class or travel across the tree to build complex combinations of skills from various disciplines. Scattered across the tree are Keystone passives, Masteries and Jewel Sockets that drastically alter the way a character is played. Armed to Kill Path of Exile is completely designed around items. Our flasks are persistent items that have mods. Our endgame areas can be found as Map items that have mods altering their challenges and rewards. We've gone as far as removing gold as a currency and basing our trade economy around orbs that can randomly reroll the properties of other items. We have carefully constructed our item system for veterans of the best Action RPGs. Explore the Atlas of Worlds The Atlas of Worlds is a series of more than a hundred high-level maps that truly test the limits of your build. As you explore the Atlas, you will eventually unveil its dark secrets and face the most dangerous bosses that Wraeclast has ever seen. In the true Path of Exile way, the Atlas of Worlds has its own Passive Skill Tree. Earn skill points for the Tree by completing maps on the Atlas and create your own unique endgame experience. Deadly Missions In your journey through Wraeclast, you will meet fellow Exiles who seek your help. Capture wild beasts for Einhar, delve into the depths of the Azurite Mine with Niko, explore the secrets of the Temple of Atzoatl with Alva or investigate a mysterious Immortal Syndicate with Jun. Once received, these missions can be completed at any time in the endgame. This optional content in Path of Exile will reward you with valuable currency, powerful tradeable items and new ways of crafting. Customise Your Hideout ​In your extensive travels throughout the Acts and the Atlas of Worlds, you will discover secret locations swarmed with dangerous monsters. Defeat them, claim the Hideout for yourself and create your own personalised town. Use your Hideout as a quiet place to trade with other Exiles, craft after battle, or expand it and use it as a personalised Guild Hall with hundreds of decorations. Be Ruthless Ruthless is an optional game mode which offers a more challenging way to play Path of Exile. Ruthless players can expect extreme item scarcity, limited crafting and many other changes such as support gems being drop-only. Ruthless is a mode about friction, tension and anticipation. It's much more difficult, but overcoming that difficulty feels highly rewarding. In a world where your items are far below par, every item drop has the potential to be the breakthrough one you need. Fair-To-Play. Never Pay-To-Win. We're committed to creating a fair playing field for all players. All Microtransactions in Path of Exile are purely cosmetic and do not affect gameplay.

There are other great strategic-level wargames out there. But I have never played anything like Hearts of Iron 4” 8.8/10 – PC Gamer “For now, after many dozens of hours, I'm taking a break from Hearts of Iron 4. Not because I'm sick of it; quite the contrary, in fact. What I need to do is some serious reading, some careful planning on what my vision for the United States should be in 1936. And when I've done that planning — when I've formulated my character sheet, as it were — I have the utmost confidence that Hearts of Iron 4 will be ready for me to play a role in world affairs.” 8/10 – Polygon ",https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/394360/header.jpg?t=1739207786,http://www.heartsofiron4.com/,http://support.paradoxplaza.com,support@paradoxplaza.com,True,True,True,83,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/hearts-of-iron-iv?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,231,237325,,"['English', 'French', 'German', 'Polish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese']",[],"[{'title': 'Buy Hearts of Iron IV', 'description': '', 'subs': [{'text': 'Hearts of Iron IV - $49.99', 'description': '', 'price': 49.99}, {'text': 'Hearts of Iron IV: Starter Edition - $59.99', 'description': '', 'price': 59.99}]}, {'title': 'Subscribe to Hearts of Iron IV', 'description': 'For a low monthly fee, gain access to all Hearts of Iron expansions and country packs, as well as lots of special cosmetic content, music and sound packs.

700330,SCP: Secret Laboratory,2017-12-29,0,0.0,0,"Deep within one of the SCP Foundation’s emergency containment sites, a catastrophic containment breach leads to multiple SCP subjects being released from their cells. With containment compromised, facility personnel rush to evacuate while waiting for Mobile Task Forces to arrive and restore order, but with the Class-D population running amok in a desperate attempt to escape, along with the involvement of the Chaos Insurgency, the fate of Site-02 remains uncertain. SCP: Secret Laboratory (SCP:SL) is a free-to-play multiplayer horror game where you must escape from fearsome entities, or fight to secure a facility under the control of the SCP Foundation, an organisation which seeks to secure and contain anomalous items and creatures in order to protect humanity. These objects, or SCPs, range from mundane-looking items with extraordinary effects, to horrific abominations capable of bypassing the most impenetrable containment methods the Foundation puts in place. Throughout the game, you will witness the perspective of the 5 different human classes, each trying desperately to survive. These include: Scientists: Foundation personnel caught in the midst of the chaos, they must work with Facility Guards and the Mobile Task Force while using their equipment and wits to escape. Class-D Personnel: Prisoners and test subjects using the breach to their advantage, they start with nothing and will do anything it takes to escape from the Foundation. Facility Guards: The woefully unequipped first responders who must help the Scientists escape, prevent the Class-D from escaping, and hold back the SCPs for as long as possible until the Mobile Task Force arrive. Mobile Task Force: Specialised re-containment agents sent into containment breaches to restore order and eliminate threats, they are tasked with assisting in the evacuation of Scientists and taking down anything that poses a threat to the Foundation. Chaos Insurgency: Soldiers of an unknown directive, who are ordered to attack major Foundation sites and terminate all Foundation personnel. They also aim to rescue Class-D Personnel in order to gather useful information from them. Site-02 is a sprawling maze of different zones. Light Containment Zone, where Scientists and Class-D Personnel reside. Heavy Containment Zone, where the SCPs are contained. Entrance Zone, where Facility Guards are stationed, and Surface Zone, where the evacuation point is located, along with the insertion points for Mobile Task Forces and Chaos Insurgents. The site is prepared for these breaches, containing numerous emergency measures — from Tesla Gates able to electrocute anything caught in the blast, to emergency bulkheads able to temporarily hold back threats from a fleeing target, or even the on-site nuclear warhead capable of vaporising the entire underground section of the site. Despite all the security precautions and safety measures, Site-02 is not impenetrable . Fight alongside and against other players in order to help the Foundation restore containment and order, sabotage the site as the Insurgency, or kill everyone as a SCP in a murderous rampage. ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ SCP:SL was initially inspired by the well-known single-player horror game, SCP – Containment Breach (2012) by Undertow Games. Northwood Studios has since deviated from Containment Breach — instead opting to create a more unique and original game environment, complete with its own expanding lore. The Studio's aspiration is to present players with an authentic and immersive game experience that is strongly rooted within the SCP universe.

About the Game A new era of shoot and loot is about to begin. Play as one of four new vault hunters facing off against a massive new world of creatures, psychos and the evil mastermind, Handsome Jack. Make new friends, arm them with a bazillion weapons and fight alongside them in 4 player co-op on a relentless quest for revenge and redemption across the undiscovered and unpredictable living planet. Key Features: All-New Characters and All-New Classes: Four all new playable classes including the Siren, the Commando, the Gunzerker and the Assassin. Step into the role of the Gunzerker, whose highly deadly skills allow him to dual-wield any two weapons found in the game. Not only that, you will build on that skill to do more things with two guns than you ever imagined possible. Dual machine guns? Cool. Dual rocket launchers? Of course! Dual Sniper Rifles? Sure, if that’s your thing! Want to try other styles? More tactical perhaps? There are multiple classes to choose from! Dynamic Co-op online, and LAN: Share your adventures with friends both online and via LAN. Borderlands 2 features a seamless system enabling you to drop in and drop out of a campaign without ever having to restart the game. On top of that you can even take your new gear from any game to any other! World Connected Story: Find yourself left for dead in the frozen tundra of Pandora as you begin your quest of revenge and redemption. Expose the evil surrounding the Hyperion Corporation and take on the perpetrator of a universe-wide grand deception -- the nefarious Hyperion CEO, Handsome Jack. (Oh, also: he's stolen credit for the opening of the Vault.) 87 Bazillion...Everything: In addition to the new gun system, you will lust after procedurally generated shields, grenades, Relics, class mods and much, much more. And you thought the original Borderlands had a ton of loot! Brand new environments on Pandora: Hunt through entirely brand new areas of Pandora that are more alive than ever! From the arctic tundra, through the dangerous grasslands, past the mysterious corrosive caverns to beyond, you’ll be surprised by the unpredictable world of Pandora at every turn! Brand new enemies: A whole slew of new enemies are out there to kill you in Borderlands 2. Hulking, gorilla-like Bullymongs, vicious predatory Stalkers and the Hyperion mechanical army, run by Handsome Jack, are just some of the new enemies in Borderlands 2. Note: The Mac and Linux versions of Borderlands 2 are available in English, French, Italian, German and Spanish only.","A new era of shoot and loot is about to begin.

1468810,鬼谷八荒 Tale of Immortal,2023-05-26,0,19.99,4,"Premium Edition About the Game Tale of Immortal is an open-world sandbox game based on Chinese mythology and cultivation. You will grow to become immortal, conquer the beasts from the Classic of Mountains and Season, make your choices carefully and grasp your own destiny. Step into the enchanting world of the Tale of Immortal, where cultivation is an art that requires more than just financial means and help from fellow cultivators. To truly master it, one must possess a deep understanding of the craft and have access to the right cultivation venues. But that's not all—the journey is fraught with danger, as you'll face unpredictable monsters, crisis-ridden mystic realms, insurmountable barriers, and brilliant treasures waiting to be discovered. As a novice cultivator in the Qi Refining stage, you'll set out from Yukong Village to cultivate your inner strength, defy the odds, and overcome adversity. With each breakthrough, you'll be able to rewrite your destiny and cleave through the thorns on your journey. Cross continents, witness the wonders of the world, and then ascend to Tian Yuan Mountain, where the ultimate enlightenment of the Way awaits. Embrace a fully-realized NPC world, where each character is a unique entity with their own friends, family, and life trajectory— completely independent of your progress. However, if you choose to meddle, you certainly can! The game is yours to shape as you wish. Collaborate with your beloved to save the day, seek revenge alone, or even become the enemy of all. The choice is yours to make. Master martial arts, teach NPCs the Taoist Mind, learn from seasoned gurus, and accept eager disciples. You can also take on the NPCs in the auction house and follow it up by drawing your sword or claiming your hard-earned spoils. As part of a group of immortal cultivators, you can either shine bright or cultivate in secrecy. It's all up to you and the path you choose to take. Are you ready to embark on a thrilling adventure? One where you might become the hero who saves the day and wins the heart of the love of your life? Or maybe you're looking to stir up some jealousy in your crush and have them fight for your affection? How about fulfilling a fifty-year-old promise or getting caught up in the struggle of a mysterious organization? Perhaps you'll uncover a long-forgotten treasure, only to have it snatched away by a cunning adversary? The possibilities are endless! But that's just the beginning! As you journey through this immersive world, apart from interacting with a rich cast of NPCs, you'll encounter a plethora of random events and side tasks that will keep you on your toes. Some might leave you feeling frustrated or hurt, while others could be just the thing to save you or make you stronger after facing danger head-on. Every decision you make will shape the narrative, leading to a unique and unforgettable story that's yours alone. Do you want to take your sect to new heights of power and glory? We've got the ultimate sect management gameplay that lets you experience the full range of sect life: from humble disciple to mighty sect master. Join a massive sect and work your way up from the bottom, or take on the challenge of leading a fallen sect back to prominence. As a Disciple, you'll complete sect missions, compete in sect tournaments, and fight for glory and resources for your sect. As an Elder, you'll be responsible for teaching and guiding your disciples, assigning tasks, and accelerating the sect's growth. The real power and responsibility, however, lie with the Sect Leader. You'll need to keep order in the sect, plan strategic attacks and defenses, and fight for precious resources like Spirit Mines. If you're ambitious enough, you can even conquer other sects and seize their exclusive 'Rewrite Destiny' and manuals. Achieve your wildest ambitions and unify the world, as long as you have the strength and the drive to make it happen. To embark on an epic adventure, you need to hone your skills and become a true warrior. Start by building a solid foundation of cultivation. Your mind skills are crucial to success, so focus on cultivating a powerful mindset. From there, you can delve into martial and spiritual skills to take your abilities to the next level. As you explore, keep an eye out for opportunities to create edges with your motion and special skills. And don't forget to tap into your ultimate skills to save the day when necessary. There are a dozen of manuals to choose from, each with its own unique characteristics. Will you specialize in one of the twelve Spiritual Roots, or master them all? What school of martial arts will you establish? The choice is yours. There are treasures to be found in every corner of this world. From the Manual Pavilion to the mystic realms and beyond, you never know what you might discover. And with hundreds of rare and exotic monsters, fellow cultivators, ghosts, demons, and immortals to test your strength against, you'll never be bored. If you're up for a challenge, why not try your luck at the Immortal Tournament or the Master Rankings? Can you break through the barriers of the Nether Mountains? Will your school rise to the occasion and prove its worth? As you journey through this perilous world, your school will be put to the test. Sharpen your skills and harness the power of tools! At the start, you get to choose from three formidable weapons, each offering a distinct cultivation system. The Bagua Jade grants you the ability to revive yourself and your chosen ally, the Eye of Providence allows you to steal Beast Skills and gain unparalleled insights into the world, and the Mythical Gourd empowers you to capture a Boss and enlist it as your loyal sidekick: command it to fight by your side or to search for treasure on your behalf. And that's not all. Refine your own Artifacts and summon Artifact Spirits to fight by your side. These Spirits not only offer you companionship but also trigger exclusive adventures and provide invaluable assistance. Moreover, hone your skills in practicing Alchemy and Talismans, mastering the art of Geomancy and Feng Shui, and crafting a plethora of items to assist you in your explorations. Confuse your enemies, slay your foes, and emerge victorious every time! Our studio hopes that in this game, players will express the theme of 'Always stick to your heart, dare to fight against difficulties; make choices carefully and grasp your own destiny.'

In corrupted backwaters lost to history, fight back alone – or with friends – against timeless evil. Twisted monsters and other ruthless Hunters stand between you and your Bounty. Risk everything as Hunt consumes you. Take rich bounties and kill anyone that tries to stop you – and they will try. Race competing Hunters to track down bosses, send them to hell, claim their bounty, and fight your way to extract. If others only slow you down, go alone. If you find strength in numbers, take up to two teammates along. Risk everything to unlock dark powers and forbidden wealth. Every bullet counts. Every wound hurts. And every death is permanent. But if you succeed, every victory will be unforgettable. Hear footsteps squelch in the mud as you wait with bated breath to strike. The world speaks. Every gunshot is a message; every howling dog a klaxon. Gramophones murmur with the haunting melodies of Port Sulphur Band. Listen, and you might live to die another day. Keep striving for more, the world is always growing. Frequent updates challenge you with new Events, expand your arsenal of weapons, introduce new characters, and offer the chance to get ornate rewards.

Los Sueños - The LSPD reports a massive upsurge in violent crime across the greater Los Sueños area. Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) teams have been dispatched to respond to various scenes involving high-risk hostage situations, active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and other criminal activities. Citizens are being advised to practice caution when traveling the city or to stay at home. It has been noted that while Los Sueños is still seen as a city where riches can be found, for many more the finer things in life are becoming less and less obtainable. “The city is sprawling with cramped high-rise apartments and decaying affordable housing, which has been exploited by the criminal underground like a malevolent parasite,” states Chief Galo Álvarez. “In a city where people are just trying to survive, lawful action from the LSPD and the LSPD SWAT team remains an integral force preventing the stretched thin social fabric in this city from snapping under this chaotic strain.” In response to the burgeoning violent crime wave inundating Los Sueños, Chief Álvarez of the LSPD has enlisted the stalwart support of David ‘Judge’ Beaumont as the Commander of the LSPD SWAT team. Shortly following this announcement, the LSPD has also confirmed active recruitment for additional talent to join this specialized tactical police unit with the mission of bringing peace back to the city. “This assignment is not for the faint of heart,” comments Commander Beaumont, “Extremists, crooked politicians, countless weapons, human trafficking, and illicit drugs and pornography… the world of policing in Los Sueños is fraught with real and harsh realities, realities that the everyday person isn’t necessarily confronted with. These are realities that you will need to navigate with your team within the proper bounds of the law or face the consequences and make matters worse.” The Los Sueños Policed Department has officially posted new details on Commander “Judge” Beaumont’s updated assignment with the LSPD SWAT team: New Expectations: Whether this is your first time in Los Sueños or not, the city has changed and so too have the tools and methods with which we conduct our work. The haunts you might have seen or heard about are re-imagined, and so have the angles with which we approach each call. Furthermore, we’ve received reports that identify at least 4 new high-risk police districts which we suspect may require future tactical intervention, plus at least 4 existing high-risk districts that underwent massive upheavals. Take Command: The role of the Commander of the LSPD SWAT is to compose their team from a large roster with unique talents, give tactical orders, meticulously plan, and carry out missions. Commanders are obligated to conduct each mission with integrity and look after their team’s mental and physical health. Officers with unaddressed deteriorating mental status may be unable to properly perform their duties or even feel compelled to quit the force. Incapacitated officers may be temporarily unavailable for missions, with the tragic prospect of death leading to a permanent loss. For SWAT Commanders in unusual circumstances based on individual choices they opt for, deadly mistakes may lead to their own permanent fatality. SWAT Team Quality Enhancement: Much anticipated improved SWAT training procedures, tactics, and experience in the LSPD has led to an overall increase in the quality and quantity of officers in our roster. Expanded tactical versatility allows our officers to take on any challenge with renewed confidence, blending coordination and independence seamlessly. There is also additional basic training now available to SWAT members to keep foundational knowledge and muscle memory in top shape. Equipment and customization: We have access to the best weapons and equipment that the LSPD can offer to fulfill our exceptionally dangerous role, including many new acquisitions. However, customization isn’t limited to the equipment we use. Through close-knit comradery while performing remarkable actions alongside the team, you’ll earn the clothes you wear, the patches on your sleeves, the artwork that may adorn your skin, and potentially even the timepiece on your wrist. Lastly, we have overhauled our headquarters' training facilities to better test our loadouts before heading out on call.

294100,RimWorld,2018-10-17,0,34.99,8,"RimWorld is a sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller. Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune. You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world. Manage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, illnesses and addictions. Build in the forest, desert, jungle, tundra, and more. Watch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses. Replace wounded limbs and organs with prosthetics, bionics, or biological parts harvested from others. Fight pirates, tribes, mad animals, giant insects and ancient killing machines. Craft structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, and futuristic materials. Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts. Trade with passing ships and caravans. Form caravans to complete quests, trade, attack other factions, or migrate your whole colony. Dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires. Capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery. Discover a new generated world each time you play. Explore hundreds of wild and interesting mods on the Steam Workshop. Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor. RimWorld is a story generator. It’s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller . There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax. Your colonists are not professional settlers – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew. Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well. Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound. The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season. Travel across the planet. You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster. You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms. People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down. Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous. You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs. And there's much more than that! The game is easy to mod and has an active mod community. Read more at . (All non-English translations are made by fans.)","RimWorld is a sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller.

Replace wounded limbs and organs with prosthetics, bionics, or biological parts harvested from others. Fight pirates, tribes, mad animals, giant insects and ancient killing machines. Craft structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, and futuristic materials. Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts. Trade with passing ships and caravans. Form caravans to complete quests, trade, attack other factions, or migrate your whole colony. Dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires. Capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery. Discover a new generated world each time you play. Explore hundreds of wild and interesting mods on the Steam Workshop. Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor. RimWorld is a story generator. It’s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller . There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax. Your colonists are not professional settlers – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew. Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well. Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound. The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season. Travel across the planet. You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster. You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms. People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down. Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous. You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs. And there's much more than that! The game is easy to mod and has an active mod community. Read more at . (All non-English translations are made by fans.)","A sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller.

From a 3/4 overhead perspective, players explore the fantasy world of Rivellon, interact with various characters, and engage in turn-based combat against human enemies and fantastical creatures (e.g., demons, skeletons, giant insects). Characters use weapon strikes and magic attacks to defeat enemies in combat; battles are accompanied by blood-splatter effects that stain the surrounding environment. Some areas depict large pools of blood amid human corpses and dismembered limbs. The game contains some sexual material: the central character can employ the services of a prostitute at a pub—no sexual activity is depicted, though the dialogue/text makes sexual references (e.g., “Your hand slides all the way up until you reach her, and you make a soft circling motion with your thumb”; “Slowly she undresses you then takes you to bed""; ""Your world explodes in bliss.""). The word “sh*t” is heard in dialogue.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Russian', 'Polish', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Italian', 'Korean', 'Czech', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Japanese']","['English', 'Japanese']","[{'title': 'Buy Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition', 'description': '', 'subs': [{'text': 'Divinity: Original Sin 2 - $44.99', 'description': '', 'price': 44.99}, {'text': 'Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Divine Edition - $59.99', 'description': '', 'price': 59.99}, {'text': 'Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Eternal Edition - $89.99', 'description': '', 'price': 89.99}]}]",['Larian Studios'],['Larian Studios'],"['Single-player', 'Multi-player', 'PvP', 'Online PvP', 'Shared/Split Screen PvP', 'Co-op', 'Online Co-op', 'Shared/Split Screen Co-op', 'Shared/Split Screen', 'Steam Achievements', 'Full controller support', 'Steam Trading Cards', 'Captions available', 'Steam Workshop', 'Steam Cloud', 'Includes level editor', 'Remote Play on Tablet', 'Remote Play on TV', 'Remote Play Together', 'Family Sharing']","['Adventure', 'RPG', 'Strategy']","['https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/435150/ss_b59e5889726cab2cf01a93d0c0d192d25928952a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725653917', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/435150/ss_34a428cdd26113e8645b77331d9fc82fcc50a4a2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725653917', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/435150/ss_66d58326ebea7154d7f3d89e02f13913452caef7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725653917', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/435150/ss_d3badb07717f13ef3316928c513f8c4c7f7b50b1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725653917', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/435150/ss_d51d3ccb39019124c45bf851bbe6a76e2461fab3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725653917', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/435150/ss_a0fa5dd2f40fffbae32af259afcf588a999e6663.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725653917', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/435150/ss_efa99b837c22f45f690f27d3c656de31a4446075.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725653917', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/435150/ss_5034004fa3690a17da2c266bc577e8aa54e2f3ef.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725653917', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/435150/ss_5ba36377bbb88fdde6c9e9ccddb581d3a952ea6a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725653917', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/435150/ss_d882a5136e99c31ac7192cd3648b0d547be53f0e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725653917', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/435150/ss_9f7699218d7acc9e1dd0a081d3a2c5cae4ffba86.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725653917', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/435150/ss_f85eb1d28993d481dcde84118f5ac23c705a8774.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725653917']","['http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/256694830/movie_max.mp4?t=1561485484', 'http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/256789813/movie_max.mp4?t=1592914188']",0,,179788,7811,5000000 - 10000000,0,0,0,0,0,7461,"{'Tactical RPG': 3141, 'RPG': 3117, 'Turn-Based Strategy': 3087, 'Story Rich': 3008, 'Fantasy': 2962, 'Character Customization': 2937, 'CRPG': 2927, 'Exploration': 2919, 'Party-Based RPG': 2901, 'Strategy RPG': 2815, 'PvP': 2705, 'Female Protagonist': 2657, 'Co-op Campaign': 1710, 'Local Co-Op': 1581, 'Choices Matter': 1514, 'Isometric': 1473, 'Romance': 1464, 'Strategy': 1447, 'Moddable': 1409, 'Funny': 1389}",95,164364,92,953

Have fun! Includes 28 great levels. Over 50 million players across all formats. More than 5000 levels in the workshop!

Each dream level provides a new environment to navigate, from mansions, castles and Aztec adventures to snowy mountains, eerie nightscapes and industrial locations.

As players explore an open-world environment in Ancient Greece, they interact with characters, infiltrate enemy bases and strongholds, and kill human enemies. Players use swords, spears, and bows to kill enemy soldiers and bandits in melee-style combat. Players also use stealth attacks (e.g., knife stabbing) to dispatch enemies discreetly. Large blood-splatter effects occur as enemies are killed. A handful of cutscenes depict more intense acts of violence and/or gore: characters stabbed through the head/neck with bladed weapons; young characters thrown off a cliff; a man mauled by a mob as his arm gets thrown into the air. Some environments depict severed limbs and dismembered corpses on the ground. The game contains instances of sexual material: characters kissing and caressing before the screen fades to black (sex is implied though never shown); dialogue referencing sex and prostitution (e.g., “Anything goes in this sex andron”; “That is love, this is commerce. What are you into?”); a character hearing sexual moaning sounds behind a door. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” are heard in the game.

For more information, check out the dedicated product page and wishlist the game today to keep updated! *Dying Light: The Beast will be available for no extra charge for owners of the Ultimate Edition of Dying Light 2 Stay Human. About the Game It’s been 20 years since the events of the original game. The virus won, and humanity is slowly dying. You play as Aiden Caldwell, a wandering Pilgrim who delivers goods, brings news, and connects the few remaining survivor settlements in barren lands devastated by the zombie virus. However, your true goal is to find your little sister Mia, who you left behind as a kid to escape Dr. Waltz's torturous experiments. Haunted by the past, you eventually make the decision to confront it when you learn that Mia may still be alive in Villedor — the last city standing on Earth. You quickly find yourself in a settlement torn by conflict. You’ll need to engage in creative and gory combat, so hone your skills to defeat hordes of zombies and make allies. Roam the city, free run across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot in remote areas, and be wary of the night. With every sunset, monsters take control of the streets. Fifteen years ago, humanity was devastated by the Fall — a catastrophic event that would change the world forever. With the Harran virus spreading around the globe, people quickly found out that all hope for tomorrow is lost. By 2036, only a few settlements remain, and humanity is slowly dying, making way for the new species out there — a horde of relentless zombies. Welcome to Villedor, one of the last bastions of humanity. During the day, survivors still try to have a life here and find a false sense of normalcy. Relationships are formed, dreams are dreamed, and life carries on. On the surface, everything seems… fine. Until sunset, that is. With the last ray of light dying out, other, more dreadful, dwellers of The City crawl out of their gloomy interiors, taking over the streets. If you are not vigilant and stay out too long in the dark, you may never return. Not all fights can be won. Sometimes it’s best to run and, thankfully, you have the skills for it. Parkour lets you escape when odds are not in your favor. Jump from rooftop to rooftop, swing across the cityscape, ride ziplines, and much more. Whatever you do, experience a unique sense of freedom as you freerun across Villedor’s buildings and rooftops in search of loot or while running away from the dangers of the night. In a world as dangerous as this one, only the strongest survive. Whether you prefer to smash, slice or dismember those who stand in your way, you have to be creative about it to make it through. And who says you need weapons? Utilize the entirety of your parkour moveset to get the jump on your enemies. Learn the ways of combat and parkour to feel the crunch of skulls and slices of flesh as you swing weapons or use your moves to fend off any forms of danger. And let’s not forget that Villedor has weapons that put the most advanced post-apocalyptic armories to shame. Surviving in Villedor is easier with friends. Team up with up to 3 other players and increase your chances out there. Unravel the story together, take on Pilgrim Outpost challenges, or simply wreak havoc on the city streets.

Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order makes up for a lot of lost time with a fantastic single-player action-adventure that marks the return of the playable Jedi.” 9/10 – IGN “Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is the ideal example of a Star Wars game in 2019. It’s an expert blend of multiple genres. It has characters that you love spending time with. It has the deeply attractive design aesthetic of the movies. But Fallen Order is more than just “a good Star Wars game.” Respawn has made one of the best 3D Metroidvania games ever. And it’s among the best Souls-like games as well. It is the kind of achievement that is only possible when one of the best developers in the world puts all of its might into making something special. And I hope we get more just like it in the future.” 93/100 – GamesBeat ,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172380/header.jpg?t=1725901454,,https://help.ea.com/,,True,False,False,81,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,39,134190,,"['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Polish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Spanish - Latin America', 'Traditional Chinese']","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese', 'Polish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Spanish - Latin America', 'Traditional Chinese']","[{'title': 'Buy STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order™', 'description': '', 'subs': [{'text': 'STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order - $39.99', 'description': '', 'price': 39.99}, {'text': 'STAR WARS Jedi: Fallen Order Deluxe Edition - $49.99', 'description': '', 'price': 49.99}]}]",['Respawn Entertainment'],['Electronic Arts'],"['Single-player', 'Steam Achievements', 'Full controller support', 'Steam Trading Cards', 'Remote Play on Tablet', 'Remote Play on TV', 'HDR available']","['Action', 'Adventure']","['https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172380/ss_695a5724e306269d81ca0118d86308a170c9e913.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725901454', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172380/ss_cfad9481db1a3b68fb5fcb2298cfc74bcb6a469e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725901454', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172380/ss_763dcc7434f072d6fdbb9037b4d37f4474e29d9b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725901454', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172380/ss_045d78dba983384cf8282e617e7ba04e40a9e2e9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725901454', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172380/ss_effd33d4b798698bec179a5721dfba527e8432f0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725901454', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172380/ss_8363c00f973874cc19a886e0370c6858a32e3793.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725901454', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172380/ss_dc2d50077b559b54f58b6dff572a4cf9479c54db.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725901454', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172380/ss_fcdc1d9848bbc604fb38e1b740eee00e90b0a366.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725901454', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172380/ss_34f07a117f50f6c587a769b5bb496d7032424786.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725901454', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172380/ss_2dbe96ff08aed7bc02c82ba5256ce7d589cb34b7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725901454', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172380/ss_8ac0d74f6e4594f1ff141fb0f2defbd701755b81.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725901454', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172380/ss_fad6cb499482042a9a2fe8f606f767c991424cdd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725901454', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172380/ss_0fcc7ad097befc7be78fbd2382be6649b3a7e7e7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725901454', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172380/ss_bd9ea6ac0dc139132a05f80065364f3c8c1d71c4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725901454', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1172380/ss_b76c3e22424cff02441d13448f4d8dfda89c11bd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1725901454']","['http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/256765709/movie_max.mp4?t=1572357561', 'http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/256764626/movie_max.mp4?t=1572357570']",0,,137167,17673,2000000 - 5000000,1180,92,955,92,0,1125,"{'Action-Adventure': 1078, 'Souls-like': 1016, 'Third Person': 1013, 'Open World': 951, 'Story Rich': 937, 'Swordplay': 927, 'Exploration': 865, 'Sci-fi': 863, 'Action': 847, 'Platformer': 826, 'Space': 803, 'RPG': 792, 'Fighting': 747, 'Puzzle': 745, 'Adventure': 744, 'Metroidvania': 739, 'Fantasy': 711, 'Atmospheric': 702, 'Hack and Slash': 695, 'Family Friendly': 607}",88,134245,86,903

Avenge the death of your parents and help repel the invading forces! Story: Bohemia – located in the heart of Europe, the region is rich in culture, silver, and sprawling castles. The death of its beloved ruler, Emperor Charles IV, has plunged the kingdom into dark times: war, corruption, and discord are tearing this jewel of the Holy Roman Empire apart. One of Charles' sons, Wenceslas, has inherited the crown. Unlike his father, Wenceslas is a naive, self-indulgent, unambitious monarch. His half-brother and King of Hungary, Sigismund the Red Fox, senses weakness in Wenceslas. Feigning good will, Sigismund travels to Bohemia and kidnaps his half-brother. With no king on the throne, Sigismund is now free to plunder Bohemia and seize its riches. In the midst of this chaos, you're Henry, the son of a blacksmith. Your peaceful life is shattered when a mercenary raid, ordered by King Sigismund himself, burns your village to the ground. By bittersweet fortune, you are one of the few survivors of this massacre. Without a home, family, or future you end up in the service of Lord Radzig Kobyla, who is forming a resistance against the invasion.

457140,Oxygen Not Included,2019-07-30,0,24.99,4,"In the space-colony simulation game Oxygen Not Included you’ll find that scarcities of oxygen, warmth and sustenance are constant threats to your colony's survival. Guide colonists through the perils of subterranean asteroid living and watch as their population grows until they're not simply surviving, but thriving... Just make sure you don't forget to breathe. Build Extensive Bases and Discover What it Takes to Survive: Everything in your space colony is under your control, from excavation and resource allocation right down to plumbing and power systems. Resources will begin depleting with your first breath, however, so be sure to dig fast if you want to live. It’s Mind Over Matter with Stress Simulations: Keep the psychological impact of survival at bay with fun leisure activities, great accommodations and even better food for your colony. Duplicants each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy. Whatever the cost. Avoid Boiling with Thermodynamics: Temperature control is a constant concern in space; too cold and you'll freeze, too hot and you'll fry. Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists. Enhance Efficiency through Complex Gas and Liquid Simulations: Create interlocking pipe systems to swiftly deliver fuel and liquid to critical areas of your base. Plan well and be rewarded as your colony transforms into an imperishable, well-oiled machine. Take Charge with Power Grid Simulations: Choose from a multitude of power sources including coal, hydrogen, natural gas or just plain old elbow grease. Manage power runoff, circuit overloads and meltdowns to keep your colony running smoothly. Always Keep Yourself Breathing: Enter the Oxygen Overlay and watch air moving through your base in real time. Monitor carbon dioxide accumulation and oversee oxygen generation processes to mold your colony into a veritable deep-space oasis. Waste Nothing through Extreme Recycling: Make use of every last resource for a base that truly exemplifies efficiency. Recycle waste into precious fuel, process unbreathable gas into air or harness the natural bodily processes of wild creatures for food. If you’re clever, you might even be able to run a base off colonist farts. Explore Diverse, Procedurally Generated New Worlds: Summon new worlds with a push of a button. Experience tons of untamed space rocks, then suffocate to death in them!

Monza, Silverstone, Imola, Mugello, Spa, Brands Hatch and many more tracks, including the historical reproduction of Monza, that brings again to life the legendary Sopraelevata, the high-speed oval where races were staged until 1961. EXCLUSIVE CARS The Assetto Corsa physics engine is all new, using practical knowledge acquired from working closely with the elite of motorsport in order to engineer the best possible accuracy of physics and tactility of feeling. A physics engine like this begs to be used with officially licensed contents: Abarth, Audi, BMW, Classic Team Lotus, Ferrari, KTM, Lamborghini, Lotus cars, McLaren, Mercedes, Scuderia Glickenhaus, Pagani, Porsche, Tatuus and many more! HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY Enjoy ASSETTO CORSA using any kind of game device: keyboard, joypad, joystick, steering wheels including any kind of professional device and the most common motion systems. ASSETTO CORSA is also compatible and ready for Oculus and OpenVR/VIVE, triple monitor view, Track IR and 3D VISION. GAMEPLAY &amp; FEATURES Assetto Corsa includes a career mode, a list of special and unique events and challenges, as well as a fully customizable, single player and multiplayer modes featuring quick races, custom championships, race weekends including free practice session, qualifying session and race. Drag races, drift challenges and much more! Four driving assist profiles (gamer, racer, pro, plus a fully-customizable profile) allow any kind of player to enjoy the simulation at their desired level. Advanced setup options and telemetry for data analysis; dynamic simulation of the tyre rubber deposited on track, depending on the car laps; an adjustable time of the day mode, featuring sun position calculated in realtime, depending by geographical coordinates of the track and by the sun curve according to time and date, in order to get the same light conditions of the real tracks! MODDING &amp; CUSTOMIZATION Assetto Corsa will allow for considerable customisation and modification, in order to satisfy the expectations of professional simracers, gamers who prefer to approach the driving experience more progressively, and hobbyists who just like to reproduce and share their cars and tracks, taking advantage of the same editing tools developed and used by the developers of the game.

2694490,Path of Exile 2,2024-12-06,0,29.99,3,"Path of Exile 2 is a next generation Action RPG from Grinding Gear Games, featuring co-op for up to six players. Path of Exile 2 takes place in the land of Wraeclast, a dark continent populated by unique cultures, ancient secrets, and monstrous dangers. A sinister threat, long thought destroyed, has begun creeping back on the edge of civilisation, driving people mad and sickening the land with Corruption. Path of Exile 2 features a brand new campaign with six acts, 100 distinct environments, 600 monsters and 100 bosses. Key Features Twelve Character Classes Path of Exile 2 features twelve character classes, two for every combination of Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence. While each of the class variants focuses on a different playstyle, they're just a starting point. You can combine skills from many classes together to create your ideal character build. Each of the twelve character classes has its own three Ascendancy specialisations, resulting in a total of 36 Ascendancy Classes to pick between. New Skill Gem System Path of Exile 2 features 240 Skill Gems that grant devastating active skills and 200 Support Gems that modify their behaviour. Combine these together to create your perfect build. This is the next generation of Path of Exile's famous skill system. Support Gems are now socketed directly into Skill Gems, removing many of the frustrations present in the old system while maintaining all the previous depth. It's now possible to six-link every skill your character uses. Dual-specialise your Passive Skill Tree Path of Exile's iconic Passive Skill Tree has made a return, with 1,500 skills that allow you to completely customise your gameplay experience. It now features Dual Specialisation, the ability to allocate some passive skill points to two different sets of skills. They engage whenever the appropriate weapon or skill type is used. For example, you can have some points allocated to both daggers and traps, or ice and lightning, and as you swap between attacks, the appropriate skill points will apply. This lets you specialise in multiple areas without opportunity cost. Uncover All-new Items Path of Exile 2 features 700 equipment base types and every single one has its own unique item you can find. You can augment your arsenal with new weapons such as Spears, Crossbows and Flails, as well as supplementary items like Focuses, Traps and redesigned Sceptres. Encounter Unique Bosses In Path of Exile 2, every area of the Campaign contains a boss encounter. There's over a hundred bosses to fight as you make your way through the Acts and they all have unique mechanics to learn. Explore a New Endgame Completing the campaign is just the beginning. The endgame in Path of Exile 2 includes countless areas in different biomes, powerful crafting, challenging bosses, unique encounters and much more. Unlock new paths and explore further into the world.  As you progress through the endgame, you will gain access to special passive trees that can boost the rewards of your maps and change the way the various endgame mechanics work. These trees will make your maps more rewarding but also more difficult. Path of Exile 2 introduces sequels to several leagues from Path of Exile. While their mechanics are familiar, the monsters, bosses, rewards and progression are all new. Fair-To-Play. Never Pay-To-Win. Path of Exile 2 is a separate game to the original Path of Exile. We will continue to offer expansions for both games going forward. They will never be 'pay to win'. Purchases are shared between the two games.

ABOUT THE GAME THE CITY MUST SURVIVE Frostpunk, the newest title from the creators of This War of Mine, is a society survival game where heat means life and every decision comes at a price. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive. Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state. What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process? MAKE THE LAW Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe. SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: there’s no turning back. WEIGH UP YOUR CHOICES Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden. DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills. EXPLORE THE FROSTLAND While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city.

About the Game Space Engineers is an open world sandbox game defined by creativity and exploration. It is a sandbox game about engineering, construction, exploration and survival in space and on planets. Players build space ships, wheeled vehicles, space stations, planetary outposts of various sizes and uses (civil and military), pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets and gather resources to survive. Featuring both creative and survival modes, there is no limit to what can be built, utilized and explored. Space Engineers features a realistic, volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed. The game can be played either in single or multiplayer modes. Volumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity. Space Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future. Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesn't use technologies that wouldn't be feasible in the near future. Space Engineers concentrates on construction and exploration aspects, but can be played as a survival shooter as well. We expect players will avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications to survive in space and on planets. Space Engineers shouldn’t be about troops; it should be about the machinery you build. CORE FEATURES Planets and moons – fully destructible &amp; persistent, volumetric, atmosphere, gravity, climate zones Game modes - Creative – unlimited resources, instant building, no death - Survival – realistic management of resources and inventory capacity; manual building; death/respawn Single-player – you are the sole space engineer Multiplayer - Creative and survival mode with your friends - Cooperative and competitive - Privacy customization: offline, private, friends only, public - Up to 16 players - Dedicated servers New game options - Scenarios - offer linear story with action-packed gameplay, while the majority of Space Engineers scenarios feature unique sandbox environments where players create their own challenges. - Workshop worlds - offer worlds created by other players. - Custom worlds - offer variety of customizable worlds where you can start your own scenario.

Drilling / harvesting Manual building in survival mode – use welder to assemble blocks from components; use grinder to disassemble and reuse components Deformable and destructible objects – real proportions, mass, storage capacity, integrity Visual script editor - players can create missions and game modes which can be played by other players. Capture the flag, death-match, racing or campaign driven missions - all can be done by using the editor, with your own rules and designs! Even main campaign and game scenarios were created in this tool. Building blocks - over 200 blocks (gravity generators, jump drive, turrets, doors, landing gears, assembler, refinery, rotors, wheels, thrusters, pistons, wind turbine and many more) Programmable block - allows players to write small programs that will be executed in the game Electricity – all blocks in a grid are wired in an electrical and computer network; electricity is generated by nuclear reactors or various power sources Gravity – produced by planets and gravity generators. Spherical gravity generator also available. Symmetry/Mirroring – useful in creative mode when building structures that require symmetry Weapons – automatic rifle, small and large explosive warheads, small ship gatling gun, small ship missile launcher Steam Workshop – share your creations with the Community (upload and download worlds, blueprints, MODs, scripts) Localized interface - Official localization: English, Russian, Chinese, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese-Brazil - Community localization: Czech, Danish, Dutch, German, Icelandic, Polish, Spanish-Spain, Spanish-Latin America, Finnish, Hungarian, Estonian, Norwegian, Swedish, Slovak, Ukrainian Cargo ships - auto-piloted vessels (miners, freighters and military) that carry ore, ingots, constructions components and other materials from sector to sector. They can be looted but beware, they often contain booby traps!

Remote control – control ships and turrets without being inside Modding - world files, shaders, textures, 3D models Modding API - brings a lot of new possibilities to modders and allows them to alter the game by writing C# scripts which have access to in-game objects Blueprints - save your ship or station on a blueprint and paste it into your game GPS - create, send, receive and manage GPS coordinates in the game Voxel hands - shape and form the asteroids and change their material (creative mode only) Xbox controller support Sounds – realistic and arcade mode Space Engineers utilizes an in-house built VRAGE 2.0, realistic volumetric-based physics engine: all objects can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed.   Performance Notes The performance depends on the complexity of your world and the configuration of your computer. Simple worlds run smoothly even on low-end computers, but a more complex world with rich object interactions could overload even high-end computers. Minimum requirements represent the bare minimum to run simple scenes and don’t guarantee a perfect experience.","Space Engineers is an open world sandbox game defined by creativity and exploration.

Simple worlds run smoothly even on low-end computers, but a more complex world with rich object interactions could overload even high-end computers. Minimum requirements represent the bare minimum to run simple scenes and don’t guarantee a perfect experience.","Space Engineers is a sandbox game about engineering, construction, exploration and survival in space and on planets. Players build space ships, space stations, planetary outposts of various sizes and uses, pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets and gather resources to survive.","“Space Engineers bring you back to your childhood when you were fighting with your LEGO ships.” 9/10 – SCORE “Space Engineers makes welding, joining and glazing seem like the best jobs in the world.

305620,The Long Dark,2017-08-01,0,9.99,4,"Bright lights flare across the night sky. The wind rages outside the thin walls of your wooden cabin. A wolf howls in the distance. You look at the meager supplies in your pack, and wish for the days before the power mysteriously went out. How much longer will you survive? Welcome to THE LONG DARK , the innovative exploration-survival experience Wired magazine calls 'the pinnacle of an entire genre'. THE LONG DARK is a thoughtful, exploration-survival experience that challenges solo players to think for themselves as they explore an expansive frozen wilderness in the aftermath of a geomagnetic disaster. There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster. THE LONG DARK: SURVIVAL EDITION brings you the genre-defining Survival Mode, honed after years of open development and frequent updates. Widely considered the paramount Survival game of all time, SURVIVAL EDITION gives you pure focus on THE LONG DARK’s Survival Sandbox -- the experience that started it all! In THE LONG DARK , you are getting both the genre-defining Survival Mode, honed after years of open development and frequent updates, and the award-winning episodic narrative mode, WINTERMUTE. Included with both THE LONG DARK: SURVIVAL EDITION and THE LONG DARK , Survival Mode is the free-form, non-narrative Survival Sandbox that has defined the genre since launching on Steam in 2014. After years of open development and dozens of major updates, THE LONG DARK now stands at the pinnacle of the entire genre. Survival is your only goal, and death your only end. Make your own survival story with every game. The game that defined death for the survival genre. When you die in Survival, your save is deleted. Every decision matters. The game challenges players to think for themselves by providing the information but never the answers. You have to earn the right to survive. Monitor your Hunger, Thirst, Fatigue, and Cold as you struggle to balance resources with the energy needed to obtain them. Every action costs Calories, and time is your most precious resource. Choose your path carefully. Over 100 gear items including Tools, Light Sources, Weapons, First Aid supplies, Clothing, and more. Explore a 50+ square kilometer Northern Canadian wilderness spanning 12 major regions and all the zones that connect them in search of life-saving supplies. Distant mountains, coastal towns, mines, farmlands, and a huge expanse of brutal winter wilderness to test your survival mettle. Hunt, fish, trap, climb, map, search for life-saving food and gear items, and try to avoid dying from the hostile wildlife, succumbing to hypothermia, frostbite, or dysentery (amongst other uncomfortable afflictions), find and maintain your life-saving gear. Hunt and be hunted by: Wolves, Bears, Moose, Rabbits, Deers, Crows, and more to come in future updates. Four distinct Experience Modes let you find a challenge level you are comfortable with, such as Pilgrim Mode, which is meant to be quiet and pensive, all the way to Interloper Mode, where only the most experienced survivors have a chance to last a week. If none of the four Experiences suits you, use Custom Mode settings to tailor your Survival Mode game to your specific tastes. Features the music of Sascha Dikiciyan. Several standalone Challenge Modes offer objective-based experiences designed to last 1-3 hours each, such as Whiteout -- the race to gather enough supplies to prepare for a monster blizzard. Or Hunted, where you need to escape a murderous Bear. Complete them to unlock Feats that provide long-term gameplay benefits in Survival Mode. Additional Challenges include: Hopeless Rescue, Nomad, Archivist, As the Dead Sleep, and Escape the Darkwalker. Included in THE LONG DARK The episodic story-mode for THE LONG DARK, WINTERMUTE, includes four of the five episodes that form WINTERMUTE. Episode Five is in development, and is slated for release at a later date. This will bring the WINTERMUTE storyline to its conclusion. The first four episodes of WINTERMUTE represent approximately 30 hours of gameplay. Episode Five is included in the price of the game, and will be unlocked for free when it is released. Bush pilot Will Mackenzie (player character) and Dr. Astrid Greenwood are separated after their plane crashes deep in the Northern Canadian wilderness in the aftermath of a mysterious flash of light in the sky. Struggling to survive as he desperately searches for Astrid, Mackenzie comes across the small town of Milton, where he begins to understand the scope of this quiet apocalypse. Mackenzie’s search for Astrid takes him deeper into the savage Winter wilderness. A mysterious trapper may be the key to finding Astrid, but can he be trusted? In the aftermath of events in Milton, an enigmatic stranger rescues Dr. Astrid Greenwood (player character) from near death. Facing the blizzards of Pleasant Valley, Astrid must bring all her skills as a doctor to bear on the survivors she encounters. But will she find Mackenzie, and get closer to the mystery that's taking them to Perseverance Mills? A murderous gang of convicts has captured Mackenzie. Desperate to escape one of the darkest corners of Great Bear Island, he must somehow survive his fiercest enemy yet. Can Mackenzie recover the Hardcase, continue his search for Astrid, and also save the innocents caught up in this deadly confrontation? NOTE: Unlike Survival Mode, WINTERMUTE does not feature permadeath. You can save your progress as you play. Features performances by Jennifer Hale, Mark Meer, David Hayter, and Elias Toufexis (Episode Three), and the music of Cris Velasco. In addition to releasing the remaining episode of WINTERMUTE, we intend to continue updating Survival Mode with limited free updates alongside our paid DLC Expansion Pass, TALES FROM THE FAR TERRITORY. This is on top of the over 100 updates we have made to the game over the past 8 years of open development. Keep in mind that your purchase of THE LONG DARK entitles you to all five episodes of WINTERMUTE without extra charge. For more information about the free updates coming to Survival Mode, please visit the Expansion Pass roadmap via our 'Visit the website' link on the right of the page.

About the Game The unbridled force of nature runs wild and relentless, with environments transforming drastically from one moment to the next. This is a story of monsters and humans and their struggles to live in harmony in a world of duality. Fulfill your duty as a Hunter by tracking and defeating powerful monsters and forging strong new weapons and armor from the materials you harvest from your hunt as you uncover the connection between the people of the Forbidden Lands and the locales they inhabit. The ultimate hunting experience awaits you in Monster Hunter Wilds. Story A few years past, a young boy named Nata was rescued at the border of the Forbidden Lands, an unexplored region the guild has yet to survey. After hearing the boy’s tale of his lone escape from a mysterious monster that attacked his village, the Guild organized an expedition into the Forbidden Lands to investigate. A Living World Environments within the Forbidden Lands can drastically change as the weather shifts constantly and suddenly. During the harsh Fallow and perilous Inclemency periods, ravenous monsters will venture out to hunt in packs, yet during the Plenty periods, wildlife is rich and abundant. Monsters The monsters who inhabit these environments have been forced to adapt to the dynamic changes that occur, using their unique characteristics to survive and thrive. Hunting As the world around them changes, so must the hunters and their tactics. Not only will hunters have a multitude of weapons and armor to choose from, but the art of the hunt itself has evolved as hunters learn to anticipate monsters’ behavior and familiarize themselves with their environment. Characters From hunting partners to fellow expedition members, you’ll encounter plenty of those who will support you on your journey.","The unbridled force of nature runs wild and relentless, with environments transforming drastically from one moment to the next.

Developed exclusively for New-Gen platforms, Batman: Arkham Knight introduces Rocksteady's uniquely designed version of the Batmobile. The highly anticipated addition of this legendary vehicle, combined with the acclaimed gameplay of the Arkham series, offers gamers the ultimate and complete Batman experience as they tear through the streets and soar across the skyline of the entirety of Gotham City. In this explosive finale, Batman faces the ultimate threat against the city that he is sworn to protect, as Scarecrow returns to unite the super criminals of Gotham and destroy the Batman forever. Product Features: “Be The Batman” – Live the complete Batman experience as the Dark Knight enters the concluding chapter of Rocksteady’s Arkham trilogy. Players will become The World’s Greatest Detective like never before with the introduction of the Batmobile and enhancements to signature features such as FreeFlow Combat, stealth, forensics and navigation. Introducing the Batmobile – The Batmobile is brought to life with a completely new and original design featuring a distinct visual appearance and a full range of on-board high-tech gadgetry. Designed to be fully drivable throughout the game world and capable of transformation from high speed pursuit mode to military grade battle mode, this legendary vehicle sits at the heart of the game’s design and allows players to tear through the streets at incredible speeds in pursuit of Gotham City’s most dangerous villains. This iconic vehicle also augments Batman’s abilities in every respect, from navigation and forensics to combat and puzzle solving creating a genuine and seamless sense of the union of man and machine. The Epic Conclusion to Rocksteady’s Arkham Trilogy – Batman: Arkham Knight brings all-out war to Gotham City. The hit-and-run skirmishes of Batman: Arkham Asylum, which escalated into the devastating conspiracy against the inmates in Batman: Arkham City, culminates in the ultimate showdown for the future of Gotham. At the mercy of Scarecrow, the fate of the city hangs in the balance as he is joined by the Arkham Knight, a completely new and original character in the Batman universe, as well as a huge roster of other infamous villains including Harley Quinn, The Penguin, Two-Face and the Riddler. Explore the entirety of Gotham City – For the first time, players have the opportunity to explore all of Gotham City in a completely open and free-roaming game world. More than five times that of Batman: Arkham City, Gotham City has been brought to life with the same level of intimate, hand-crafted attention to detail for which the Arkham games are known. Most Wanted Side Missions – Players can fully immerse themselves in the chaos that is erupting in the streets of Gotham. Encounters with high-profile criminal masterminds are guaranteed while also offering gamers the opportunity to focus on and takedown individual villains or pursue the core narrative path. New Combat and Gadget Features – Gamers have at their disposal more combat moves and high-tech gadgetry than ever before. The new ‘gadgets while gliding’ ability allows Batman to deploy gadgets such as batarangs, the grapnel gun or the line launcher mid-glide while Batman’s utility belt is once again upgraded to include all new gadgets that expand his range of forensic investigation, stealth incursion and combat skills.

Surrounded by five others, a third of your group have been infected with the Game Master’s deadly virus and tasked with taking down the other innocent players. Innocents must stay alert, traverse the three zones and escape through the safety hatch as the infected try to pick you off one by one. When playing as an innocent, you’ll progress through the map and come across items to help you survive as you advance towards the exit. However, you will need to decide which of these are most valuable to you, and whether to collaborate or fight with other players to get your hands on them. Every decision gives you more information on your teammates and what side they’re likely to be on. A test of strategy and skill, innocents must work together to gather weapons, secure objectives and vote out those suspected of infection to strengthen their chances of survival. But the environment has been setup to cause conflict amongst the group, creating doubt about the true intentions of players. The infected will be busy collecting blood and trying to cover up their sabotage attempts, whilst the innocents will be keeping an eye out for suspicious behaviour and attempting to make alliances with those they think they can trust. At the end of each zone, a blackout period occurs, allowing the infected players to transform into their terror form and attack. You’ll need this form to kill innocent players. In terror form you’re faster, stronger, and have better vision than your innocent victims and with an array of intense killing animations you’ll be able to create some frightening but also amusing gameplay! Deceit combines the frenzy of fast paced combat mixed with strategic gameplay, and of course the psychological mind games of determining who you can trust.","Deceit tests your instincts at trust and deception in an action-filled, multiplayer first-person shooter.

Delve into Dungeons Assemble a group of hardy cube-kind and crawl your way through huge dungeons unique to each realm. Brave deadly minions, bosses, and traps to “liberate” powerful armor and weapons, or dip into smaller Lairs for single servings of danger perfect for solo fun.

Synopsis: In the remote mountains of Colorado, horrors wait inside Mount Massive Asylum. A long-abandoned home for the mentally ill, recently re-opened by the “research and charity” branch of the transnational Murkoff Corporation, the asylum has been operating in strict secrecy… until now.

A vertical metropolis of gambling and grit, just beyond the reach of Stonehall and Revtel; White Spire is known as a smugglers' paradise with loose morals and colorful residents to spare. Despite being overrun with syndicates, gangs, and secret societies, White Spire has never descended into chaos for one reason: Momma Eeb.

A vertical metropolis of gambling and grit, just beyond the reach of Stonehall and Revtel; White Spire is known as a smugglers' paradise with loose morals and colorful residents to spare. Despite being overrun with syndicates, gangs, and secret societies, White Spire has never descended into chaos for one reason: Momma Eeb. She was respected... she was loved... and unfortunately, she was murdered last week. Eeb’s death has sent one question rippling through White Spire’s underworld: who is going to run the city? STRATEGIZE TO WIN: Recruit heroes and upgrade them into more powerful versions of themselves. MIX AND MATCH: Each hero you recruit can form unique alliances. Stacking your team with allied heroes will unlock powerful bonuses that can crush your rivals. UNDERLORDS: Choose from four Underlords to lead your crew to victory. Underlords are powerful units who fight on the field alongside your crew, and they each bring their own playstyle, perks, and abilities to the table. CROSSPLAY: Play on your platform of choice and battle players across the globe in a hassle-free crossplay experience. Running late? Start a match on your PC and finish it on your mobile device (and vice versa). Your profile in Dota Underlords is shared across all devices, so no matter what you play on, you're always making progress. RANKED MATCHMAKING: Everyone starts at the bottom, but by playing against other Underlords you'll climb through the ranks and prove you're worthy to rule White Spire. TOURNAMENT-READY: Create your own private lobbies and matches, then invite spectators to watch 8 Underlords duke it out. OFFLINE PLAY: Offering a sophisticated AI with 4 levels of difficulty, offline play is a great place to hone your skills. Pause and resume games at your leisure. SEASONAL ROTATION: Every season we'll say goodbye to certain Heroes, Items, and Alliances to make room for new additions that will shape the ever-evolving world of Underlords.","Hire a crew and destroy your rivals in this new strategy battler set in the world of Dota. Introducing Season One: Explore White Spire and earn rewards on the Battle Pass. Pick from several different game modes, play on your own or with friends, and take advantage of crossplay on PC and mobile.",,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1046930/header.jpg?t=1649700104,http://underlords.com/,https://help.steampowered.com,,True,True,True,0,,0,0,,"['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Bulgarian', 'Czech', 'Danish', 'Dutch', 'Finnish', 'Greek', 'Hungarian', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Norwegian', 'Polish', 'Portuguese - Portugal', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Romanian', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Spanish - Latin America', 'Swedish', 'Thai', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Turkish', 'Ukrainian', 'Vietnamese']",[],"[{'title': 'Buy Dota Underlords', 'description': '', 'subs': [{'text': 'Dota Underlords - Commercial License (Free) - Free', 'description': '', 'price': 0.0}]}]",['Valve'],['Valve'],"['Single-player', 'Multi-player', 'PvP', 'Online PvP', 'Cross-Platform Multiplayer', 'Partial Controller Support', 'Steam Cloud', 'Remote Play on Phone', 'Remote Play on Tablet']","['Casual', 'Free To Play', 'Strategy']","['https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1046930/ss_25ad872bc9a8ecf634a76ce1d4bb22aea9b728c9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649700104', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1046930/ss_1bc613845672667a6e1f957e269543de629ace39.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649700104', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1046930/ss_3eb9d9284194794e69d31b4d764b902d424f1af2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649700104', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1046930/ss_cda4d2ee1a88f6640a8b1cac5c27647ad28a816f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649700104', 'https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1046930/ss_4c73e18e4b0242a25b8bd73576560deb7ff8124d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649700104']",['http://video.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_trailers/256881738/movie_max.mp4?t=1649700096'],0,,74736,16119,5000000 - 10000000,0,0,0,0,0,1323,"{'Free to Play': 735, 'Strategy': 600, 'Auto Battler': 506, 'Casual': 485, 'Multiplayer': 266, 'Tactical': 197, 'Chess': 195, 'Turn-Based Tactics': 186, 'Turn-Based': 152, 'Mature': 102, 'Competitive': 91, 'Fantasy': 74, 'Board Game': 71, 'Card Game': 66, 'Deckbuilding': 61, 'Singleplayer': 57, 'PvP': 51, 'Co-op': 44, 'Automation': 42, 'MOBA': 33}",82,90859,78,93

Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is the new co-op focused experience from the award-winning team behind the Vermintide series. In the depths of the hive, the seeds of corruption threaten to turn into an overwhelming tide of darkness. A mysterious and sinister new force is seeking to take control of the entire city. It is up to you and your allies in the Inquisition to root out the enemy before the city succumbs to Chaos. As Tertium falls, Rejects Will Rise. Built on the legacy of Vermintide 2’s best-in-class melee combat, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide introduces intense WH40K gunplay to the mix. Master the balance between ranged and melee combat as you fight through a slew of enemies. Feel the impact of each swipe, swing, and slice of a chainsword, or fry some flesh with a lasgun. Darktide is a co-op game. Wandering too far, risks punishment by foes looking to immobilize or capture stray Rejects, such as the slavering Chaos Hound or the Moebian Trapper. Once you fall prey to such foes, only your teammates can save you! More than that, your innate toughness – your determination to press on through the pain – only recharges when you are in the proximity of your strike team. Create your own, unique character and customize their physical appearance, voice, and origin. Choose your class to determine which unique traits and skill sets they will make use of in battle. Will you be a seasoned veteran of the Imperial army, a snarky outsider, or a fiery zealot? The choice is yours. Step into the violent, dystopian world of Warhammer 40,000. From boiling hot industrial factories to the decaying water maintenance zone afflicted by constant acid rainfall - Tertium Hive is a hard and unforgiving place even at the best of times. Your role is to serve the zealous Inquisition by embarking on missions to exterminate the threats lurking in the depths of the hive city, or die trying. Adapt to the erratic whims of Chaos with conditions- mutators that add a spontaneous challenge to your mission. Your team must learn to adjust, adopt new tactics and change up their loadouts to face these ruthless challenges.

SCUM is a truly immersive and hyper realistic survival experience where you have total control of your progression. You start as a prisoner on the super-max SCUM island under the watchful eye of the sinister TEC1 corporation. Roam the rolling fields, lush forests and other rugged terrains of the island, using skills, guts and cunning to survive. Incredibly complex simulation makes every detail matter. Eat the right diet, keep your wounds free of infection or it won’t just be the physical threats that take your life. Seek to take out other players or join forces while you loot and craft your way to better gear and weaponry. Flex your creative muscles with extensive base building options and reinforcements that will make your fortress impenetrable. The island is vast and full of ways to die, from fellow prisoners to killer mechs and sinister ‘puppets’ suspended between life and death. All you have is what you’re carrying – everything else is up to you. Inventory space is minimal. Progression will be tough. Noobs will die. Oh, and one more thing… you’re not just a prisoner. TEC1 is also an entertainment company, and they’re broadcasting every triumph and failure on SCUM island to a bloodthirsty audience of millions. So smile...you’re on TV. SCUM is built with Unreal Engine 4 and will expand throughout the Early Access period. Fans can follow details on development with weekly dev updates on the SCUM website and on Twitter @SCUMgame. FEATURES Complex Simulation: SCUM utilizes dozens of complex systems, allowing you to go as deep as you choose into character creation and management. Immerse yourself in the survival experience through systems that control your character’s metabolism, inertia during movement, and even how fast layers of clothing dry on and off the body. The devil is in the details... Massive Landscape: Explore 225 square kilometres of terrain that includes dense forests, picturesque beaches, serene fields, abandoned towns and rundown airfields. This enormous terrain can be traversed by foot, land vehicles, boats or aircraft. Each location tells its own story, presenting new dangers…and opportunities, too. Tough progression: loot what you can and craft with raw materials. Improvise, adapt and upgrade. Think smart, take risks and carry what you need. Build and protect your base with a wide range of customization options. Grow your character and become the terror of the whole island. Omnipresent threat: Discover new ways to die in a punishing world without a moral code. Face your fellow prisoners, armed mechs, undead puppets and your own metabolic system – if your rivals don’t get you, maybe dehydration will. Online Multiplayer: You can go solo or squad up. Survive with up to 64 players per server with the option to rent your own server.

The follow-up game to the award-winning Source mod, Insurgency is highly competitive and unforgivingly lethal, striking a balance between one-life gameplay and prolonged action. Features Over 40 weapons with numerous attachments, no crosshair, and a focus on realistic weapon behavior including a free-aim system and intense suppression effects. 16 maps playable in day and night versions on various multiplayer and cooperative modes, ranging from environments in the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia. 7 multiplayer game modes supporting up to 32 players, with a focus on territorial control, destroying weapon caches and escorting high value targets. 5 cooperative game modes where you and your friends team up to complete mission-based objectives. Free content updates that include weapons, game modes, maps, and new features. Offline practice mode, playing with bots on all game modes. Squad system built upon role-based player classes, which are customizable and asymmetrical based on what team you are on. Squad-based communication system which includes 3D VOIP, allowing friendly and enemy players within proximity to hear you. Overhead map detailing objective and teammate locations. Accumulate supply to customize and upgrade your gear, affecting your weight, stamina, and movement speed. Simplified HUD and UI for a clean, immersive user experience focused on the action and environments. Highly immersive particle FX and audio to intensify the game experience. Create custom maps and content using the Insurgency SDK and scripting system, and share them on the Steam Workshop. Playable on PC, Mac OSX, and Linux with multiplayer cross-compatibility. Dedicated Server Support for PC and Linux. Multiplayer Game Modes: Push --- Three territorial objectives must be captured by the attacking team in sequential order. For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand. Firefight --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork. Skirmish --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match. Occupy --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or 'tug of war'. Ambush --- A high value target ('HVT') must be escorted to an extraction point. It's one team's goal to make this happen and it's the other team's goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate. Strike --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry. Infiltrate --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team's goal is to take the enemy's intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy's intel, or when an enemy stealing your team's intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy. Flashpoint --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy's caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective. Elimination --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers. Cooperative Game Modes Checkpoint --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way. Hunt --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life. Survival --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates. Outpost --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates. Conquer --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them.

For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand. Firefight --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork. Skirmish --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match. Occupy --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or 'tug of war'. Ambush --- A high value target ('HVT') must be escorted to an extraction point. It's one team's goal to make this happen and it's the other team's goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate. Strike --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry. Infiltrate --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team's goal is to take the enemy's intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy's intel, or when an enemy stealing your team's intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy. Flashpoint --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy's caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective. Elimination --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers. Cooperative Game Modes Checkpoint --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way. Hunt --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life. Survival --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates. Outpost --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates. Conquer --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.","Take to the streets for intense close quarters combat, where a team's survival depends upon securing crucial strongholds and destroying enemy supply in this multiplayer and cooperative Source Engine based experience.",“This game has me hooked and I see it as a proudly raised middle finger in the face of large developers who seem to completely ignore fairness and player equality in favour of potential income.” 9.0 – Hooked Gamers “Insurgency is going to win fans for its gameplay.

Choose from four unique, varied factions and wage war your way – mounting a campaign of conquest to save or destroy a vast and vivid fantasy world. This is a game of two halves – one a turn-based open-world campaign, and the other intense, tactical real-time battles across the fantastical landscapes of the New World. Play how you choose – delve into a deep engrossing campaign, experience unlimited replayability and challenge the world in multiplayer with a custom army of your favourite units. Total War: WARHAMMER II offers hundreds of hours of gameplay and no two games are the same. World-Spanning Conquest Engage in statecraft, diplomacy, exploration and build your empire, turn by turn. Capture, build and manage teeming settlements and recruit vast armies. Level up Legendary Lords and Heroes and arm them with mythical weapons and armour. Negotiate alliances or declare Total War to subjugate any that stand between you and your goal. Epic Real-Time Battles Command thousands-strong legions of soldiers in intense tactical battles. Send forth ferocious, twisted monsters, fire-breathing dragons and harness powerful magic. Utilise military strategies, lay ambushes, or use brute force to turn the tide of combat and lead your forces to victory. The second in a trilogy and sequel to the award-winning Total War: WARHAMMER, Total War: WARHAMMER II brings players a breath-taking new narrative campaign, set across the vast continents of Lustria, Ulthuan, Naggaroth and the Southlands. The Great Vortex Campaign builds pace to culminate in a definitive and climactic endgame, an experience unlike any other Total War title to date. Playing as one of 8 Legendary Lords across 4 iconic races from the world of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, players must succeed in performing a series of powerful arcane rituals in order to stabilise or disrupt The Great Vortex, while foiling the progress of the other races. Each Legendary Lord has a unique geographical starting position, and each race offers a distinctive new playstyle with unique campaign mechanics, narrative, methods of war, armies, monsters, Lores of Magic, legendary characters, and staggering new battlefield army abilities. Shortly after launch, owners of both the original game and Total War™ WARHAMMER II will gain access to the colossal third campaign. Exploring a single open-world epic map covering the Old World and the New World, players may embark on monumental campaigns as any owned Race from both titles. Conquer the world, together Each of the Races in Total War™ WARHAMMER II will be playable in single and multiplayer campaign, plus custom and multiplayer battles. As the two Legendary Lords for each race all have their own unique campaign start positions, you’ll be able to play a 2-player co-op campaign as the same race. If you own both parts 1 and 2, you’ll be able to play in multiplayer as any of the races you own. The World of Total War: WARHAMMER II Millennia ago, besieged by a Chaos invasion, a conclave of High Elf mages forged a vast, arcane vortex. Its purpose was to draw the Winds of Magic from the world as a sinkhole drains an ocean, and blast the Daemonic hordes back to the Realm of Chaos. Now the Great Vortex falters, and the world again stands at the brink of ruin. Powerful forces move to heal the maelstrom and avert catastrophe. Yet others seek to harness its terrible energies for their own bitter purpose. The race is on, and the very fate of the world will lie in the hands of the victor. Prince Tyrion, Defender of Ulthuan, guides the High Elves in their desperate efforts to stabilise the vortex as it roils above their home continent. Atop his palanquin-throne, the Slann Mage-Priest Mazdamundi directs his Lizardmen war-hosts as they surge northward from Lustria. He, too, is intent on preventing cataclysm, though the methods of The Old Ones must prevail. The Witch King Malekith and his sadistic Dark Elf hordes spew forth from Naggaroth and their labyrinthine Black Arks. He tastes great weakness in the vortex – and great opportunity in its demise. Meanwhile the Skaven, led by Queek Headtaker, stir in their foetid subterranean tunnels. There they multiply unchecked and look hungrily towards the surface, their motives obscured. The time for revelation is nigh… Four races, four outcomes, a single goal: control of the Great Vortex, for good or ill. ","DEFEND YOUR WORLD. DESTROY THEIRS.

The Combine’s control of the planet since the Black Mesa incident has only strengthened as they corral the remaining population in cities. Among them are some of Earth’s greatest scientists: you and your father, Dr. Eli Vance. As founders of a fledgling resistance, you’ve continued your clandestine scientific activity—performing critical research, and building invaluable tools for the few humans brave enough to defy the Combine. Every day, you learn more about your enemy, and every day you work toward finding a weakness.

376210,The Isle,2015-12-01,0,19.99,0,"The Isle: A World Designed to Kill You The Isle is intended to be a gritty, open-world survival horror game. Explore vast landscapes of dense forest and open plains, traverse treacherous mountains and wade through dark swamps where horrors lurk. Hidden within are ruins that hold insight as to what came before. Through it all, keep in mind there is only one goal: survive. There is little in the way of hand holding or ulterior precepts to alter play styles or purpose. It's kill or be killed. In the end, the only one you can trust is yourself. Over the course of development the islands and their inhabitants will radically change, ever-evolving as players themselves learn how to flourish and thrive. Your mistakes will be punished. Expect no survivors. Massive Prehistoric Multiplayer Become the beast within. When joining The Isle, you can play as one of dozens of unique creatures, from tiny darting herbivores like Dryosaurus to blood-thirsty giants such as T. Rex or Allosaurus (with many more still to come!) As a dinosaur, you'll be the epitome of majestic, cunning and ferocious. Use your natural abilities and senses to stay off the menu and grow into a stronger, more capable creature. Engage with a living prehistoric ecosystem as you become either predator or prey on servers featuring up to 100+ players, all of them as hungry and dangerous as you. Form packs/herds, create nests, defend your offspring, hunt, and claim territory. A single mistake can spell your demise. Survival or Sandbox? The Isle's core game mode is Survival, a tense and difficult experience where you need to grow fast or die young. Dinosaurs in Survival mode progress through several life stages, starting out small and vulnerable. Use your scent ability, night vision and wits to survive long enough to grow, becoming more powerful and unlock new abilities such as nesting. Because of the time needed to develop a full character life cycle, not every creature is or will be playable in Survival, though more will be added in future updates. However, sometimes you don't want to struggle to survive, or you don't have the time to go through a dinosaur's whole life story. And that's okay. For players who want a less intense experience, Sandbox mode lets you play an expanded roster of dinosaurs (and soon humans!). You can jump right in as an adult super predator or a peaceful giant, with no major penalties or consequences from dying. We won't judge. A Global Community Story The Isle features a narrative told strictly through the environment, achievable only through immense cooperation among players. Are you stranded? Can you just leave? What is AE? How did the dinosaurs get here? What is the distant call that pierces the night? It will take the entire community to answer these mysteries and unravel the purpose to their being on The Isle, and each discovery will directly affect the future of the game's storyline. Future Development Goals We realize that there is a long road ahead, and a lot of work to be done to turn this into the game we want it to be. Throughout development, we will be adding a lot more to The Isle and incorporating user feedback in how we evolve the experience. Some of our planned features include: Playable aquatic and aerial creatures Even more playable dinosaurs with complete life cycles Two new playable factions: modern humans &amp; the indigenous Evolve into advanced 'strain' versions of certain dinosaurs Realistic dinosaur AI that uses complex behaviours Additional world biome types such as thick jungles Dynamic aerial drop-in spawn system Global in-game world quest Localization of all in-game menus &amp; text Better accessibility &amp; customization options Steam Achievements, Trading Cards, Emotes Mod support using Steam Workshop All that and more are on our radar going forward. We started with a plan of just a mere handful of playable carnivores, but based on player demand we expanded our scope, increased that number greatly and introduced herbivorous dinosaurs as well. Listening to our community has been instrumental in guiding our process and helped to correct our mistakes, and we hope that together we can transform The Isle into the ultimate dinosaur game. --AE Core TX Received-- --End Promotional Protocol-- --SiGnaL InTeRrUpt-- -tHEeNdISnevErTheENDisNeVeRtHeEnDIsNev -","The Isle: A World Designed to Kill You The Isle is intended to be a gritty, open-world survival horror game.

About the Game In KILLING FLOOR 2, players descend into continental Europe where the outbreak caused by Horzine Biotech’s failed experiment has quickly spread and gained unstoppable momentum, essentially paralyzing the European Union— Just one month after the events in the original KILLING FLOOR, the specimen clones are everywhere and civilization is in disarray; communications have failed, governments have collapsed, and military forces have been systematically eradicated. The people of Europe know survival and self-preservation too well and lucky survivors have gone into hiding. Not all have given up hope though... A group of civilians and mercenaries have banded together to combat the outbreak and established privately funded operation bases across Europe. Upon tracking specimen clone outbreaks, players will descend into zed-laden hot zones and exterminate them. KEY FEATURES: • Visceral Gore - KILLING FLOOR 2 ramps up the gore with a proprietary, high powered persistent blood system bringing new levels of fidelity to the genre. Players will send entrails, severed limbs, and blood flying as they wade through hordes of enemies. But they need to watch out! If caught, enemies will rip them, and their entire party limb from limb • 6 player co-op or solo play— A multitude of varied playable characters await for players to choose from as they enter the fray in online co-op mode or solo mode for those willing to brave the horrific specimens alone • Versus Survival Game Mode - Be the Zed! A 12 player PvP mode where two teams take turns playing Humans vs. Zeds in a pair of short matches. In the first match, one team plays Humans and the other Zeds until the humans all die during a single round or they beat the boss.

The people of Europe know survival and self-preservation too well and lucky survivors have gone into hiding. Not all have given up hope though... A group of civilians and mercenaries have banded together to combat the outbreak and established privately funded operation bases across Europe. Upon tracking specimen clone outbreaks, players will descend into zed-laden hot zones and exterminate them. KEY FEATURES: • Visceral Gore - KILLING FLOOR 2 ramps up the gore with a proprietary, high powered persistent blood system bringing new levels of fidelity to the genre. Players will send entrails, severed limbs, and blood flying as they wade through hordes of enemies. But they need to watch out! If caught, enemies will rip them, and their entire party limb from limb • 6 player co-op or solo play— A multitude of varied playable characters await for players to choose from as they enter the fray in online co-op mode or solo mode for those willing to brave the horrific specimens alone • Versus Survival Game Mode - Be the Zed!

Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh desert. Train your men up from puny victims to master warriors. Carry your wounded squad mates to safety and get them all home alive.

The game will never seek to limit you or restrict your personal play style. Custom design as many characters as you want and build up a whole squad to fight for you. Characters will grow and become stronger with experience, not just in their stats but their appearance too. Build a base where you can research new technologies, upgrade your defences and craft new gear. Original take on the RTS-RPG hybrid genre. No 'hero' characters with artificially stronger stats than everybody else- Every character and NPC you meet is potentially an equal, and has a name, a life. You are not the chosen one. You're not great and powerful. You don't have more 'hitpoints' than everyone else. You are not the center of the universe, and you are not special. Unless you work for it.

This is not just a 'game', you are living and surviving in a simulated world. Get captured by cannibals and eaten alive , or sold off by slavers and forced to work in the mines. These are not scripted events, just a regular part of this chaotic world that ruins your life by chance. Anything can happen, yet anything can be overcome if you have the strength. Absolutely no Level-scaling. The world does not level up along with you, and the shops don't change their inventory to only items matching your level. At the start of the game almost everyone will be stronger than you, and survival will always be a struggle. The game won't hold your hand or help you when you're down. Realistic medical system that affects gameplay. A character with a wounded leg will limp or crawl and slow the party down, wounded arms means you must use your sword one-handed or not at all. Severe injuries will result in amputees needing robotic limb replacements. Blood loss means you can pass out, and the blood will attract predators. A character’s stats are affected by equipment, encumbrance, blood loss, injuries and starvation. Intelligent AI that allows for characters to reason and work towards long-term goals and desires.

Even the stars lose their brilliance, dimming slowly, and everything succumbs to an eerie silence... Messages arrive from the distant cosmos, both unfamiliar and yet strangely familiar. “Warning...Upload power is insufficient...Seeking high-energy targets...Attempting self-replication... Anomaly... Replication exceeds limits... Warning... High-energy target detected!!!” Icarus, the CentreBrain has intercepted signals from an unstable energy source. They are approaching the sector you are in. Their characteristics match those of the mechanical bodies that previously destroyed COSMO factories, as known as Dark Fog. They likely have reached the nearby sectors. Be fully prepared, COSMO will provide you with the technology to defend against them, ensuring the smooth implementation of the Dyson Sphere Program. This update is the first part of the combat system, and there will be future content related to space combat. Building space stations and confronting space hives are already in our plans. About the Game Dyson Sphere Program is a sci-fi sandbox construction game with space, adventure, exploration and factory automation elements. In the future, humanity creates a supercomputer known as the 'CentreBrain' with the hope of utilizing its powerful computing capabilities to further expand the application of virtual worlds. You are a space engineer in charge of a project launched by the space alliance COSMO, tasked with a massive undertaking: constructing Dyson Spheres (a megastructure that would orbit around a star, harnessing all its power and energy) to produce the energy that CentreBrain needs. Each game features a unique and one-of-a-kind universe Start with a small workshop and improve it until it spans the whole galaxy Engage in battles, construct defensive structures to repel enemy attacks Explore a vast universe with various celestial bodies, including neutron stars, white dwarfs, red giants, and even black holes Automate production beyond planetary surfaces, transporting resources across star systems Develop your very own Dyson Spheres Perfectly show the constructions you've completed on a planet's surface Blueprint allows you to save important plans Customize the mecha to create unique designs and traverse the universe with your creation To construct a Dyson Sphere, you need to utilize automation. Start simple and gradually increase complexity. Maximize the stable output of resources through automated facilities. Connect resources with conveyor belts, transporting raw materials to processing facilities, and then conveying the products to the next stage. Progress from basic transport lines to elaborate plans for factories with diverse outputs. Utilize your production to drive technological advancements, meeting the necessary conditions for building the Dyson Sphere. During the construction, buildings will automatically snap to the grid. When laying conveyor belts, the use of snapping allows for automatic alignment, significantly improving efficiency. This enables the creation of large-scale automated production lines. The construction of the Dyson Sphere relies on vast and efficient factories. The convenient blueprint technology allows you to save your essential plans. You can save factory designs as blueprints and deploy them directly in other locations, eliminating the hassle of repetitive operations. You can construct Dyson Shells on multiple orbits, and each layer of the Dyson Shell can be customized. Connect various nodes on the Dyson Shell, creating the patterns you desire. Each Dyson Sphere is a unique masterpiece crafted by you. Each planet will have unique mineral distribution and ecological characteristics. Every time you enter the game, you can experience a randomly generated and entirely new starmap, with landscapes and resource deposits changing accordingly. Each planet has its own orbit, experiencing the gravitational effects of its star with rotation and revolution, resulting in day and night changes influenced by the star. In addition, there are unique celestial bodies such as neutron stars, white dwarfs, red giants, and even black holes, awaiting your exploration in this vast universe. The resources on a single planet might be insufficient for such an extensive project. You can harness the abundant resources of other planets. Overcoming the constraints of surface transport, establish your interstellar transportation routes. Interconnect planets with fleets of transport ships, tapping into the unique resources of each planet to ensure an uninterrupted supply of raw materials for your factories. Not only can you paint Icarus in your favorite colors, but you can also customize every component, creating your vision of a futuristic light industrial mech. The Dark Fog has arrived, resenting countless challenges to your factory construction endeavors. In addition to pursuing the goal of building the Dyson Sphere, you must also focus on defending your factories in Rise of the Dark Fog. The Dark Fog will do everything possible to hinder the progress of the 'Dyson Sphere Program,' with Icarus also being a target of their attacks. Be prepared! Don't rely solely on Icarus to face the overwhelming numbers of the Dark Fog. COSMO has devised contingency plans to assist you in repelling the attacks of the Dark Fog. While constructing factories, you'll need to deploy essential defense structures. The more active your operations, the more frequently the Dark Fog will launch fierce assaults. Utilize your defense facilities to unleash 'fireworks' and disperse the Dark Fog. We are Youthcat Studio from Chongqing, China. Starting as a team of five, we have grown steadily (though not excessively) as we journey alongside Dyson Sphere Program. Driven by our love for science fiction, we've created this game—taking you from building the first mining machine to establishing automated factories across the cosmos.

224260,No More Room in Hell,2013-10-31,0,0.0,1,"CHECK OUT NMRIH2 Just Updated Now with Steam Workshop! Check out custom maps and download other modifications by the community. About the Game 'When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.' A tribute to the highly acclaimed film series in which the above quote originated from, No More Room in Hell (PC Gamer's Mod of the Year 2011, ModDB's Editor Choice Multiplayer Mod of the Year 2011), is a co-operative realistic first person survival horror modification for the Source Engine. Taking inspiration from George Romero's 'Of the Dead' series, the mod is set during a time in which the world is on the verge of collapsing into chaos from a disease whose origin is unknown. Many experts and organizations have their theories and ideas on how such a disease emerged and started to systematically destroy our very way of life, but one fact is clear to all. Whoever perishes from the disease gets up and kills, and the people they killed get up and kill. The chances of you surviving this all out war of society and the undead are slim to none. Already, there are millions of the walking dead shambling about, searching for food to eat. There's no known cure. One bite can possibly end it all for you. However, you aren't alone in this nightmare. There are still a handful of uninfected survivors left in this god forsaken hellhole, and with co-operation and teamwork, you may live long enough to fight your way to salvation. Features: Teamwork: Co-operative play with up to eight players. Voice and Text Communications Limited by Distance: The further you're away the harder it is for other players to hear you. Keep those walkie talkies close! Dynamic Objective Maps: The next playthrough may not be the same as the last! Survival Mode: Defend and maintain your shelter against the undead in the hopes of getting extracted to a safe area. A Realistic Approach: In short, no crosshairs with limited 'only when you want it' HUD. In addition, ammo and weapons are extremely scarce. With that in mind, aim down your sights and shoot for the head! Multitude of Different Opponents: Ranging from the iconic 'walking zombie' to the more contemporary 'runners', NMRiH will keep you on your toes with a mix of dangerous foes to face down. However, the most dangerous enemy may not always be the walking dead... Infection: One bite may be what it takes to bring you down. If infected, you must decide if you want to alert your team to rid you of your burden, or to keep quiet in the hopes of finding a cure... 30+ weapons and counting, ranging from the diminutive .22 Target Pistol, to the almighty Chainsaw. No ads (on official and community official servers, user-hosted servers may vary) No pay to win items or microtransactions 100% Free (unless you buy the soundtrack DLC &lt;3) No More Room in Hell is a Half-Life 2 Zombification. The mod was founded in 2003. It switched hands and a new team took over in 2009. Beta version 1.0 was released on Halloween of 2011. A full list of the No More Room in Hell Team and contributors can be found on the about page of our website: .","'When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth.'

Select a hero [or team up in co-op] and battle your way to the bottom of the Gungeon by surviving a challenging and evolving series of floors filled with the dangerously adorable Gundead and fearsome Gungeon bosses armed to the teeth. Gather precious loot, discover hidden secrets, and chat with opportunistic merchants and shopkeepers to purchase powerful items to gain an edge. The Gungeon: Enter the Gungeon – a constantly evolving bullet hell fortress that elegantly blends meticulously hand-designed rooms within a procedurally-generated labyrinth bent on destroying all that enter its walls.

The Cult of the Gundead: The Gungeon isn’t just traps and chasms – calm your nerves and steady your aim as you face down the gun-totting Cult of the Gundead. These disciples of the gun will stop at nothing to put down the heroes in their tracks and employ any tactics necessary to defend their temple. The Gungeoneers: Choose between one of several unlikely heroes, each burdened by a deep regret and in search of a way to change their past, no matter the cost. Filled with equal parts courage and desperation, these adventurers won’t hesitate to dive across flaming walls, roll through a wall of bullets, or take cover behind whatever is around to make it to their goal alive! The Guns: Discover and unlock scores of uniquely fantastic guns to annihilate all that oppose you in the Gungeon – each carrying their own unique tactics and ammunition. Unleash everything from the tried and true medley of missiles, lasers, and cannonballs to the bizarrely effective volley of rainbows, fish, foam darts, and bees! Yep, bees.

1818450,STALCRAFT: X,2022-12-09,0,0.0,0,"STALCRAFT: X is an exciting online MMOFPS game with Survival Horror elements. It combines open world, RPG and dynamic shooter. For more than 10 years, our team has been creating a unique living world of Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, that will give you new emotions and impressions. GAMEPLAY DESCRIPTION Dive into the world through an atypical for MMO cinematic non-linear storyline, which creates the feeling of passing single-player game in the stalker setting for dozens of hours. In the Zone, your choices always matter, and you'll be able to try on any role and find an activity to your taste: hunting for artefacts or players with artefacts, exploring territories and caches, trading, science, banditry, faction wars and a huge variety of other PvP and PvE activities. You'll also have your own hideout for resting and preparing for new raids, which you can equip with various furniture and useful structures for crafting. LIVING OPEN WORLD The world of STALCRAFT: X will truly surprise you. In addition to real players creating unique situations for each other, it is filled with NPCs and mutants living their normal lives, as well as factions fighting and trading with each other. The zone is not only dangerous, but also a very beautiful place — various anomalies affect the view of the area and add a special charm to the post-apocalyptic world. At all locations you can be shot by players from another faction, but you will not lose your equipment and progress, but will lose most of the resources you've gained during your trip. Thanks to this, you will keep the thrill of each raid, and failures will not be fatal. UNIQUE COMBINATION OF FPS AND RPG GENRES The balance of weapons is not typical for open-world MMOs and is rather reminiscent of session shooters like Counter Strike and Call of Duty. We characterise the shooter component as fast-paced, tied primarily to shooting skills and terrain knowledge. Over the years, we have managed to combine FPS and RPG elements in a unique combination, which makes STALCRAFT: X special among other games of a similar genre. PROGRESSION AND OPEN ECONOMY Don't let the MMO genre scare you. There are no levels in our game, and development happens by obtaining new equipment in many ways, including buying it from other players. STALCRAFT: X has an open economy, where everyone can become a famous merchant without leaving the base! By the way, there are no wipes in our game — this means that your progress will be saved forever and will not be deleted. DISTRIBUTION MODEL Our game is distributed for free, but monetisation is organised on a “Pay for time” model. Any items can be obtained in-game, but the soft monetisation method allows you to speed up some areas of character progression or get cosmetic items.

Fight, explore, melt, burn, freeze and evaporate your way through the procedurally generated world using spells you've created yourself. Explore a variety of environments ranging from coal mines to freezing wastelands while delving deeper in search for unknown mysteries. Pixel-based physics: Every pixel in the world is simulated. Burn, explode or melt anything. Swim in the blood of your foes! Enter a simulated world that is more interactive than anything you've seen before. Your own magic: Combine spells to create your own magic as you delve deeper into the caverns. Use magic to crush your enemies and manipulate the world around you. Procedurally generated world: Explore a unique world every time you play. Discover new environments as you adventure deeper. Action roguelite: Death is permanent and always a looming threat. When you die, don’t despair, use what you’ve learned to get further on your next adventure. Noita is being developed by Nolla Games, a company set up by 3 indie developers, all of whom have worked on their own projects in the past. The three gents in question are: Petri Purho Petri is best known as the creator of Crayon Physics Deluxe. In his youth he also made a lot tiny freeware games. He has also made a bunch of board games, but he hasn't told about it to anyone. So please keep it a secret. Olli Harjola Olli is known for the award-winning, mind-bending sci-fi puzzler The Swapper. Besides indie games, he also dabbles in music, live visuals and making programming languages. Arvi Teikari Arvi is also known as Hempuli. Over the years he has released a lot of tiny experimental games, so many in fact that he is unaware of all of them. One of the games he remembers making is Baba Is You.","Noita is a magical action roguelite set in a world where every pixel is physically simulated.

Upgrade to Legendary Status! About the Game An Unforgiving Hardcore First-Person Fantasy Dungeon Adventure. Unfathomable fortunes await the brave and the foolish willing to delve into the devastated depths of an ancient citadel. Band together with your friends and use your courage, wits, and cunning to uncover mythical treasures, defeat gruesome monsters, while staying one step ahead of the other devious treasure-hunters. Once you’ve plundered your riches, now comes the hard part, getting out alive. Find the hidden escape routes before the ever-expanding darkness reclaims your riches and your corpse to her irresistible hoard. Irresistibly Classic Dark and Darker aims to capture the wonder and awe of classic fantasy adventure games. We stand on the shoulders of giants and strive to pay respects to the traditions of the genre. We hearken back to the old worlds where danger lurks around each corner, but where courage and adventure are rewarded with untold riches. Choose a role, party up! Team up with friends and assemble a party to increase your chances of survival. Choose from a wide array of timeless fantasy roles and build the perfect three-person squad. Play as a brawny barbarian holding the frontlines while your sharp-eyed ranger friend fires arrows from afar and your merry bard sustains morale with a lively tune. Unforgivingly Hardcore Dark and Darker is a world of high risks and high returns. Explore a mystical underground fortress where the dangers are unrelenting and even the smallest misstep can result in death. Sound judgement reaps huge rewards, but death carries a heavy penalty with the loss of all your loot. A focus on First-Person Combat Dark and Darker strives for high immersion. Adventurers must use their eyes and ears like you would in the real world. Players must target, track, and aim against the countless challenges they encounter. We supply a wide array of close combat weapons that each have unique patterns to learn and master. Strikes to the head and back do critical damage. Knowing how to properly wield each weapon gives the player an edge to survive in this harsh world. Old Magic Magic is a powerful but unwieldy force in the world of Dark and Darker. Mastery requires long incantations, special skills, the right channeling equipment, and a tactical eye. Spells must be timed and aimed for maximum effect. For the magically uninclined, tinkering, knowledge of special equipment, and a little foresight can help level the field. Comfort in the Shadows The darkness is your friend in this unrelenting setting. Turn off lights and use the darkness to hide from foes or set up ambushes. If the tides of battles take a turn for the worse, blending into the darkness can lead to a stealthy retreat. Escape! Discover hidden portals to delve deeper and deeper underground and uncover the most hideous monsters and invaluable artifacts. All the riches you collect are for naught if you can’t make it out alive. Find a rare exit before the dark swarm comes to collect your soul.","An Unforgiving Hardcore First-Person Fantasy Dungeon Adventure.

2399830,ARK: Survival Ascended,2023-10-25,0,44.99,8,"Respawn into a new dinosaur survival experience beyond your wildest dreams… as ARK is reimagined from the ground-up into the next-generation of videogame technology with Unreal Engine 5! You awake on a mysterious island, your senses overwhelmed by the blinding sunlight and brilliant colors bouncing off every surface around you, the azure waters of a verdant Island lapping at your bare feet. A deep roar echoes from the misty jungle, jolting you into action, and you stand up – not afraid, but intrigued. Are you ready to form a tribe, tame and breed hundreds of species of dinosaurs and other primeval creatures, explore, craft, build, and fight your way to the top of the food-chain? Your new world awaits… step through the looking-glass and join it! FEATURES ARK: Survival Ascended has completely recreated and redesigned the artwork and worlds of ARK to take advantage of the latest in videogame technology, Unreal Engine 5, using high-end graphics features such as fully dynamic Global Illumination (“Lumen”), so that light bounces realistically off of surfaces and provides realistic reflections, and advanced mesh streaming (“Nanite”) of hundreds of millions of triangles for extreme detail. Advanced new physics systems such as dynamic water so that every creature creates waves, ripples, splashes, and bubbles as they move through fluids, and fully interactive physical foliage where every blade of grass, bush, and tree reacts to characters, explosions, projectiles, and physics objects. Knock down a tree, and see it crash into other trees and disturb all the foliage on its way down to smacking into the grass below! Detect an enemy moving sneakily through the grass as it shifts and sways in response to their presence. Demolish a building and watch the pieces break apart realistically, interacting with the grass and water as they fall. ARK: Survival Ascended includes access to all of ARK’s worlds, including Scorched Earth, Aberration, Extinction, ARK Genesis Part 1, ARK Genesis Part 2, and more. The Island, Scorched Earth, Aberration and The Center are released now, Extinction will be released on December 16 , with the subsequent expansion worlds to be added at no additional cost on a regular basis. The definitive survival experience returns better than ever: design your Survivor, form a tribe, and tame, train, breed &amp; ride dinosaurs within a living ecosystem. Watch your food, water, temperature, and weather patterns. Slowly expand outwards as you harvest, build structures, farm crops, customize your visual designs, and proceed to explore to uncover the true nature of The Island and the worlds beyond. Thorough Quality of Life revamps in every area: redesigned User Interfaces, dynamic navigation for intelligent creature pathfinding, Wild Babies, Photo Mode, new Camera systems, new Map system, Tracking System, new Structures and Items, new Creatures, and much more. Cross-Platform Modding: Download &amp; play new custom content created by players, including new maps, creatures, items, and game modes, through a dedicated mod collection directly within the game! Enjoy an endless stream of new ARK content as the creativity and talent of the community is fully unleashed for the first time ever across gaming platforms! Cross-Platform Multiplayer: form your online tribe across different gaming platforms as you work together to survive and thrive on the ARK! Supports public online multiplayer for up to 70 players, private-session multiplayer for up to 8 players, and local split-screen for 2 players.

Check out the announcement post for more details! ","The world is a vast, beautiful, and dangerous place – especially when you have been shrunk to the size of an ant. Explore, build and survive together in this first-person, multiplayer, survival adventure. Can you thrive alongside the hordes of giant insects, fighting to survive the perils of the backyard? Uncover the mysteries while playing through the story! How did you wind up so small? Who did this to you? How do you go home? These are all answers you will uncover as you play through the story. Solo or with friends – anytime! You can face the backyard alone or together, online, with up to three friends. Not only that, but with the Shared Worlds feature, you can continue to play in your shared world even if the original host is not on, with all your progression saving! Nowhere is safe – not even your base! Creatures can be found roaming the yard in a multitude of environments, such as the depths of the pond, the caverns of the termite den, and even the sweltering heat found in the sandbox. You can even attract them to different places in the yard by activating the MIX.R devices. However, the more you interfere with the creatures in the yard, the higher the chance that they come knocking at your own door, so you better prepare. Play true to your playstyle! Use the in-game customization systems such as Mutations and Milk Molars to activate the bonuses and perks you want for your character.

Find out more on the official Crossout website! Update Notes How to link your Steam and Gaijin accounts If you previously played Crossout or have a Gaijin account, we recommend that you link your Steam and Gaijin accounts when you first start the game through Steam.If this is not done when you first start the game from Steam, then in the future you will not be able to link your accounts. We encourage you to sign up for a Gaijin account if you don't have one. This will allow you to continue to use all the additional features of the game. Here is a brief guide on how to link your Steam and Gaijin accounts Once you've launched the game, you will see these fields on your screen. To link the accounts, enter your Gaijin account data (e-mail and password), click 'Log in' and confirm that you want to link your accounts. If you haven't got a Gaijin account or if you choose not to link accounts, you can log into the game through the 'Sign in with Steam ID' button. But you will no longer be able to link your accounts in the future. Attention! If you failed to link accounts by mistake and entered the game only through Steam, but still want your accounts to be linked, we recommend that you do not make any in-game actions, especially in the market, and contact support. We will try to help you. If you previously played ‘War Thunder’, then most likely your accounts are already linked. You can learn more about linking accounts at the Technical Support website. Please, pay attention that there are 2 guides available: How to link your Steam account to your email address (In case you've been playing using the game launcher) How to link your Gaijin-account to your Steam-account (in case you've been playing the game using Steam) About the Game Crossout — is a postapocalyptic MMO action game where you can create a unique design for an armoured vehicle from dozens of parts and then drive it into multiplayer battles raging on land and in the skies alike. Key Features: Unique vehicles, crafted by the players using a wide range of available parts: from maneuverable buggies and armoured aircraft flying high in the sky to heavy rovers on tracks and antigravitational battle platforms. Complete freedom of creativity and millions of possible combinations: create vehicles of any shape using dozens of parts, wide variety of armour and weapons as well as support systems. Advanced damage model: destroy any part of an enemy machine and it will affect the vehicle's performance immediately. Huge arsenal of weapons: from chainsaws, drills and machine guns to missile launchers, drones and invisibility modules. Your own workshop: create new parts and auction them at the in-game marketplace. Trading options between players: almost every piece that you have gathered in the battle can be sold to other players. Choose your own battle strategy: you can play by yourself or find a clan, participate in battles and tournaments. The only thing that matters is the Survival and Victory! CROSSOUT - The Road to Apocalypse In 2027, a mysterious disease outbreak swept over the entire planet. Some died instantly, while others experienced hallucinations and unbearable pain. The source of the disease, which journalists dubbed 'Crossout', and the mechanism of its development could not be determined. Within a few months, humanity was nearly wiped out. Only small groups of people were spared by Crossout, but it forced them to fight for survival in the desolate Wasteland. The survivors began to gradually change, and after about fifteen years, these changes affected their appearance as well. But the core qualities of people remained unchanged: peace among them was impossible. The armoured vehicles, originally built for survival, became increasingly armed. People formed factions, each with their own unique knowledge, technologies and perspectives. Some of them strive to rebuild the old world, but for others the world is synonymous with chaos and destruction. But this fragile balance was shaken when the survivors encountered mysterious robots known as the Ravagers, which can erase memories.","Crossout — is a postapocalyptic MMO action game where you can create a unique design for an armoured vehicle from dozens of parts and then drive it into multiplayer battles raging on land and in the skies alike.

Recently, the Brotherhood of Dawn has infiltrated the Crimson Keep, a mysterious republican fortress lost among the northern deserts known as the Red wastes. While the purpose of the attack was unclear, the republican Senate voted a retaliation act against all known locations of the Brotherhood.

In short words - that means you can now experience lots of never-seen-before playthroughs and struggle with new challenges. Main changes: Remastered versions of all the classic locations One new classic scenario and a brand-new character New quests and locations added to the original game Vanilla version of the game ABOUT THIS WAR OF MINE: In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival.

No. Is it a game anyone with a beating heart should play? Yes. A million times yes. It's a longform exercise in empathy, a sobering piece of work that fills in the blanks left when all we see of war are the headshots. It's a much-needed course correct in the current shoot-first-ask-questions-never gaming landscape that supposes war is won because one supreme badguy caught a bullet through his brainstem.

Combining a gripping turn-based campaign game of empire-building, statecraft and conquest with stunning real-time battles, Total War: THREE KINGDOMS redefines the series in an age of heroes and legends. China in 190CE Welcome to a new era of legendary conquest. This beautiful but fractured land calls out for a new emperor and a new way of life. Unite China under your rule, forge the next great dynasty, and build a legacy that will last through the ages. Choose from a cast of 12 legendary Warlords and conquer the realm. Recruit heroic characters to aide your cause and dominate your enemies on military, technological, political, and economic fronts. Will you build powerful friendships, form brotherly alliances, and earn the respect of your many foes? Or would you rather commit acts of treachery, inflict heart-wrenching betrayals, and become a master of grand political intrigue? Your legend is yet to be written, but one thing is certain: glorious conquest awaits. ANCIENT CHINA RECREATED Discover Three Kingdoms China, a land of breath-taking natural beauty. Battle across lush subtropics, arid deserts and snow-capped mountains. Marvel at legendary landmarks like the Great Wall of China and the Yangtze River. Explore the length and breadth of ancient China as you restore harmony to its embattled landscape. CHINA’S GREATEST LEGENDS Forge a new empire as one of 12 legendary Warlords drawn from China’s celebrated historical epic, the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Peerless commanders, powerful warriors and eminent statesmen, these characters each have a unique playstyle and objectives. Recruit an epic supporting cast of heroes to command your armies, govern your provinces and strengthen your growing empire. Characters are the beating heart of the game, and China’s very future will be shaped by its champions. GUANXI SYSTEM Modelled on Guanxi, the Chinese concept of dynamic inter-relationships, Total War: THREE KINGDOMS takes a paradigm-shifting approach to character agency, with iconic, larger-than-life heroes and their relationships defining the future of ancient China. Each of these characters is brought to life with their own unique personality, motivations, and likes/dislikes. They also form their own deep relationships with each other, both positive and negative, that shape how your story plays out. ARTISTIC PURITY With stunning visuals and flamboyant Wushu combat, THREE KINGDOMS is the art of war. With beautiful UI, vibrant vistas and authentic Chinese-inspired artwork, this reimagining of ancient China is a visual feast. REAL-TIME &amp; TURN-BASED HARMONY The turn-based campaign and real-time battles of Total War: THREE KINGDOMS are more interconnected than ever before. Actions in battle now have much greater consequences, affecting your Heroes’ relationship towards you, as well as the friendships and rivalries they develop with other characters. In a world where powerful allies are one of the keys to success, this adds a brand-new element to how victory is achieved.","Total War: THREE KINGDOMS is the first in the multi award-winning strategy series to recreate epic conflict across ancient China.

1363080,Manor Lords,2024-04-26,0,39.99,0,"Manor Lords is a strategy game that allows you to experience the life of a medieval lord. Grow your starting village into a bustling city, manage resources and production chains, and expand your lands through conquest. Inspired by the art and architecture of late 14th century Franconia, Manor Lords prioritizes historical accuracy wherever possible, using it to inform gameplay mechanics and visuals alike. Common medieval tropes are avoided in favor of historical accuracy in order to make the world feel more authentic, colorful, and believable. Manor Lords provides a gridless city-building experience with full freedom of placement and rotation. Building mechanics are inspired by the growth of real medieval towns and villages, where major trade routes and the landscape influenced how settlements formed and developed. Spreading outward from a central marketplace, build your residential, commercial, and industrial districts following the natural lay of the land. Establish farms based on soil fertility, position hunting grounds according to animal populations, and ensure access to adequate resource deposits and forests to provide the raw materials needed for growth. Assign areas for housing and watch your residents build their homes in accordance with the historical burgage plot system. Each area will be subdivided based on your roads and the allotted space, and homes will scale accordingly. Build extensions behind larger homes to generate resources that would not otherwise be available. Homeowners don't just pay taxes – they grow vegetables, raise chickens and goats, and otherwise supply themselves and other townsfolk with essential needs beyond what your managed farms, pastures, and industries can provide. Guide your settlements through the unique demands and opportunities of each season, enjoying the bounty brought by spring rains and preparing for the harsh snows of winter. From boots to barley and hides to honey, Manor Lords features a great variety of goods fitting of the era. Materials need to be transported and processed into finished products through production chains, and you must balance the basic needs of your people against the desire to produce luxury items to ensure happiness, manufacture trade goods for export, or forge arms and armor to aid in your conquests. Resources are littered across the map, encouraging you to expand and establish multiple specialized settlements. Extract valuable ores from your mining colonies, while villages devoted to agriculture, herding, or hunting supply the grains and meats needed to feed your growing populations. Will you spend your hard-earned influence to first acquire a rich source of iron for your smiths, or will you prioritize regions with fertile soil to serve as your breadbasket? Unchecked expansion will have a direct effect on the environment. Herds of deer will migrate away from encroaching civilization, lack of crop rotation will worsen soil fertility, and cutting down too many trees will result in deforestation. Establish trade routes and sell surplus goods to traveling merchants to enrich your population. Manufacturing and exporting a variety of goods will provide wealth with which to upgrade your peoples’ homes, import goods you can’t produce yourself, and through taxes on said wealth, fill your own coffers. Yours is but a small parcel of land in a vast territory, and the competing ambitions between you and rival lords will inevitably lead to conflict. Lead your people into battle, not as expendable units to be easily replenished, but as your beloved loyal subjects where every death is a cost worth considering. Train a retinue of skilled warriors to fight battles alongside the levies you raise from the town militia. At times these soldiers will be needed to suppress banditry, and at other times you will lead your men into battle to conquer or defend territory. When needed, mercenaries are a costly option to bolster your ranks. Will you raise the militia at the first sign of trouble, bringing your economy to a stand-still as your peasants pick up arms and rush to form ranks, or will you spend your personal wealth to hire bands of sellswords instead? Command real-time tactical battles, taking into consideration fatigue, weather conditions, and equipment. Position your troops wisely – a smaller force can defeat a larger enemy, if commanded well. Feel the cost of battle, even in victory, as each fallen soldier represents a lost person from your city. This game is a passion project started by a solo developer .

BATTLE BEYOND THE UNDERWORLD As the immortal Princess of the Underworld, you'll explore a bigger, deeper mythic world, vanquishing the forces of the Titan of Time with the full might of Olympus behind you, in a sweeping story that continually unfolds through your every setback and accomplishment. MASTER WITCHCRAFT AND DARK SORCERY Infuse your legendary weapons of Night with ancient magick, so that none may stand in your way.

Grow closer to them through a variety of new interactions, and experience countless unique story events based on how your journey unfolds. EVERY RUN IS ITS OWN ADVENTURE New locations, challenges, upgrade systems, and surprises await as you delve into the ever-shifting Underworld again and again. Reveal the mysteries of the Arcana Altar, tame witchy familiars, and gather reagents using Tools of the Unseen to get closer to your goal. THE PERKS OF IMMORTALITY Thanks to a variety of permanent upgrades and the return of God Mode, you don't have to be a god yourself to experience what Hades II has to offer.

If played haphazardly it can be a wonderful farce rich with hilarious anecdotes, but played patiently and carefully it’s a horror game, a top-down voyage into the heart of darkness, an eternal raging fire I forever try but can only fail to douse.” RPS 'Prison Architect, to be sure, is an excellent game, worthy of comparison to its canonical inspirations, Dwarf Fortress and Bullfrog Productions’ 1990 construct-and-manage simulations. Few games can hope to match Prison Architect’s emergent storytelling, and fewer still can balance brutality and poignancy like it does.'

333930,Dirty Bomb®,2015-06-02,0,0.0,0,"Update Notes DIRTY BOMB GOES FREE To help us celebrate several years of Dirty Bomb we wanted everyone to be able to get their hands on Weapon Skins, on existing Obsidians, and on Mercs without spending real money. To that end, we’ve removed RADs from the game entirely. For those of you with RADs they have been converted to Credits, which can also be earned in-game. UPDATED CREDIT EARN RATE To make sure you guys earn whatever you want more quickly, we’ve upped the Credit earn rates from 19 per minute to around 70 per minute, but this varies based on player performance. You'll find Credit Boosters in Advancement Crates to boost this rate. Players can also earn thousands of Credits by completing Contracts and getting their Daily Play Rewards. ITEM COSTS So how much does stuff cost, you ask? Let’s take a look: Loadout Cases Loadout Case – 5,000 5 Loadout Cases – 25,000 10 Loadout Cases – 50,000 Crafting Bronze Loadout Card – 1,500 Silver Loadout Card – 5,000 Silver Loadout Card (Weapon Select) – 15,000 Gold Loadout Card – 25,000 Gold Loadout Card (Weapon Select) – 75,000 Cobalt Loadout Card – 50,000 Cobalt Loadout Card (Weapon Select) – 150,000 Weapon Cases Weapon Case Key – 14,500 Unlocked ALICE Mk 1 – 25,000 Unlocked Aquila Mk 1 – 25,000 Unlocked CoreSEC Mk 1 – 25,000 Unlocked Royal Force Mk 1 – 25,000 Merc Loadouts Bronze Loadout Card – 17,500 STREAM TRADING UPDATE Steam Trading has now been enabled for even more items in Dirty Bomb! We know you’ve all been asking for it, so we made it a priority for this build. Now all Loadout and Weapon Cards are tradable. REINTRODUCTION OF BACK CATALOGUE ITEMS We went back and looked through some of the amazing (and not so amazing – looking at you Dapper Doge) content we’ve made for Dirty Bomb that’s no longer available. We’re incredibly proud of the work we’ve done, and with the removal of real money purchases, we thought that now would be the perfect time to reintroduce some of the most popular stuff. Some of the Cases and Trinket text still refers to the events from which they came, but are no longer active.

This game won’t hold your hand, in fact it is more likely to kick your teeth in. With no controller support or aim assist, all that lies between you and certain death is player skill and reaction. Work together or die alone in the most challenging team-based FPS. A string of 'dirty bomb' attacks cripple London, leaving the Central Disaster Authority to restore it. When criminal syndicate Jackal begin disrupting and stealing their technology, the capital is thrown into chaos as mercenaries from across the globe are hired by both sides. That's where you come in. After all, what’s a little radiation sickness when there’s money to be made?

Play The World's Game with 17,000+ players, over 700 teams in 90+ stadiums, and more than 30 leagues from all over the globe. GAME MODES VOLTA FOOTBALL — For the first time on Steam, FIFA 21 presents: VOLTA FOOTBALL, a game mode that strips football back to its core. Experience the soul of the streets together with friends as you create your Avatar with the freshest gear and show off your style in over 20 football playgrounds around the world throughout various forms of small-sided football. We created VOLTA SQUADS so you can experience a more social street football experience, joining together with up to 3 friends or dropping into the community with other VOLTA FOOTBALL players. FIFA Ultimate Team (FUT) — Join the most popular mode in FIFA, where you can build your dream squad of players past and present. For the first time, we’ve introduced FUT Co-Op, a new way to team up with a friend online and compete for rewards. Join forces in both Division Rivals and Squad Battles to earn weekly progress, and work towards brand new Co-Op Objectives that reward playing together beyond winning on the pitch. Choose sights, seats, sounds, and more as you build your dream stadium. Pack the seats, pick some epic Tifos, and grow your home ground on the way to the global stage. Career Mode — Manage every moment in FIFA 21 Career Mode with new additions that create more depth in matches, transfers, and training. Manage your team in licensed versions of the world’s biggest competitions — including the UEFA Champions League, CONMEBOL Libertadores, Premier League, LaLiga Santander, and Bundesliga — as you take your team to the top. House Rules — House Rules are back in FIFA 21. The premise of House Rules is simple. You can play matches that follow a different set of rules or even no rules at all. This creates space to have fun in between your serious matches. It's also a good way to introduce friends and new players to FIFA 21, allowing them to get comfortable with The World’s Game. With exciting play modes like Survival and No Rules, there is something for everybody to play. When playing FIFA 21 on Steam, you can use your DUALSHOCK 4 and Xbox controllers to play your way.
